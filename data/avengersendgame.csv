1,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?<br/><br/>The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).<br/><br/>Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale.</div>",Negative
2,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night.</div>",Negative
3,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.</div>",Negative
4,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You can't even consider this a film. It's a 3 hour tv episode. Films should work on their own. Even batman returns and the dark knight understood this, and work on their own. This ""film"" is okay enough. The ""original"" score is terrible. The acting is decent. The CGI is way overused, not a single shot without some CG ""enhancements"". The story is, well, near nonexistent once you take out the action sequences. I'd give this a 5/10. Only rated it 1 star because a franchise film does not deserve a spot in the top 100.</div>",Negative
5,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.</div>",Negative
6,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie dosent deserve to be this high on IMDb,it was bring and by far the worst avengers movie with a disapointing and predictable outcome,it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie,endgame was by far the worst most overrated marvel movie</div>",Negative
7,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old. The humor was terrible and the story was fragmented. Really don't understand how people are rating this so high. Maybe another movie, Idiocracy, explains it all - people are just satisfied by dumber crap.</div>",Negative
8,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really</div>",Negative
9,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.</div>",Negative
10,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really liked Infinity war and really wanted to see the next movie. To my surprise it was pathetic. Thanks God I wathed it on Blu Ray and many scenes I simply skipped.</div>",Negative
11,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.</div>",Negative
12,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Potboiler at best ... confusing to say the least. This was just an opportunity for these actors to make a shed load of money without trying. How it ever got 8.6 is beyond me ..</div>",Negative
13,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film</div>",Negative
14,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money.</div>",Negative
15,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was a joke,its barely a movie and more of an event this isint even an original movie the only thing this movie did to bring in people was have old mcu movies to make fans feel nostalgic,endames time travel logic was horrible, most overrated movie ever</div>",Negative
16,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4</div>",Negative
17,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.<br/><br/>Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average.</div>",Negative
18,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow cliché that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration.</div>",Negative
19,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The whole thing is just a disaster. The very premise, that Thanos thinks getting rid of half of the living things in the universe (not half the human or half the sentient beings, but half the cows &amp; half the chickens &amp; half the space creatures too) is just to dumb to handle. A five-year-old could tell you that's a stupid plan, and yet we're supposed to believe a Titan can't see the flaw in it? (I'd say the single bright spot here is Steve Rogers's backside. Truly, America's ass.)</div>",Negative
20,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it.</div>",Negative
21,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke.
Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel.
Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish.
I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating.
It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought.
I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful.</div>",Negative
22,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So boring and predictable story with cringe moments such a dissapointment</div>",Negative
23,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.</div>",Negative

47,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It started off alright but then it messed with time travel and it just got worse. It devolved into chaos and everyone was screwed over.</div>",Negative
48,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Hmmmm, nah.
Big purple guy is hero, film shot from perspective of the villains and their selfish motivations. Defending their myopic view of the universe.
Mark Ruffalo deserves a golden globe but only for the pars where he is The Hulk.
Not enough love making, who are we without love?</div>",Negative
49,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .""<br/><br/>I have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.<br/><br/>In other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again.</div>",Negative
50,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie. Ranging from the grossly obvious CGI to the poorly written-out story line, Endgame is extremely underwhelming. Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War.</div>",Negative
51,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans.
Hope they make it up to us with their next movie.</div>",Negative
52,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't like being disappointed by it but it didn't do all the years of build up and the characters justice. It has good comedy but ultimately felt like a lacklustre way to end things. Less of an Endgame more of just an ending.</div>",Negative
53,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was bored throughout this movie.
1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes.
2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence.
3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG.
I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.</div>",Negative
54,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did.
I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again. So dissappointed.</div>",Negative
55,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.</div>",Negative
56,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's long, and I don't mean in time length, but plot. It FEELS loooooong. The LOTR trilogy flew by. This...did not. And I'd love to know why Cpt. Marvel was in there at all. The climax is amazing. It is truly the climax of climaxes, but that's not surprising. Any superhero movie with its salt, is going to have a badass battle against good and evil.</div>",Negative
57,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Too many cringe worthy moments.
Too much talking not enough action.
This is superhero movie, not looking for bloodly oscar performance.
Time travel thing was silly nonsense. I felt like walking out.</div>",Negative
58,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Left the cinema disappointed!<br/><br/>Not a patch on infinity war - in fact I would of preferred finishing the franchise with infinity wars ending! Ragnorak had natural humour - they tried forcing humour into this and it went down like a lead balloon!<br/><br/>Predictable drivel focussing on boring characters - how are people giving this over a 5? Made a mockery of the 21 films before it - hulk and Thor's character????? Ridiculous!<br/><br/>Avengers infinity war 9/10
End game 2/10<br/><br/>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</div>",Negative
59,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Complete garbage. The Marvel Universe is far too overrated and pathetic, there is nothing cool or funny in this silly universe</div>",Negative
60,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Gave it an extra star because the ending was a fitting finale. If you haven't seen this at a movie theatre, then just wait for it to come to Netflix or whatever streaming service Disney will release. I was in the theatre for close to 4 hours and it's just not worth it.</div>",Negative
61,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where to begin. 30 mins in I got an uneasy feeling. An hour in something felt very wrong. Two hours in I was in shock. This film is a bloated, BORING, convoluted slog of time travel utter nonsense. The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but...
During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War. I thought I was walking in to the greatest comic book super hero movie ever and I could not be more disappointed.</div>",Negative
62,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Too much hype
Toooooo many loopholes
The story is so impossible that it makes fiction look like fiction .. I mean it always was but this gives me physical indigestion
People are crazy dumb to say it is awesome because nothing makes any sense
What with nebula from the future killing nebula from the past !!!
What with captain America returning on a bench and not in the time machine !!!
Just any damn thing .. senseless .. in coherent .. logically defunct</div>",Negative
63,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've expected much more as it was the final chapter but to be honest infinity war was much more interesting and mind banding, the story happened in the end game I expected them almost all of them before watching the movie so I was waiting to be proved wrong and get excited unfortunately I wasn't, End game was more emotional rather than interesting, they paid too much attention to viewers satisfaction they did what emotional viewers would have wanted.<br/><br/>End of the story</div>",Negative
64,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity.
Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining.
Can't wait for blu ray disk</div>",Negative
65,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.<br/><br/>This film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.<br/><br/>I wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime.</div>",Negative
66,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long.</div>",Negative

85,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.</div>",Negative
86,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did.
I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again. So dissappointed.</div>",Negative
87,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was bored throughout this movie.
1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes.
2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence.
3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG.
I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.</div>",Negative
88,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't like being disappointed by it but it didn't do all the years of build up and the characters justice. It has good comedy but ultimately felt like a lacklustre way to end things. Less of an Endgame more of just an ending.</div>",Negative
89,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans.
Hope they make it up to us with their next movie.</div>",Negative
90,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie. Ranging from the grossly obvious CGI to the poorly written-out story line, Endgame is extremely underwhelming. Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War.</div>",Negative
91,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .""<br/><br/>I have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.<br/><br/>In other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again.</div>",Negative
92,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It started off alright but then it messed with time travel and it just got worse. It devolved into chaos and everyone was screwed over.</div>",Negative
93,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Hmmmm, nah.
Big purple guy is hero, film shot from perspective of the villains and their selfish motivations. Defending their myopic view of the universe.
Mark Ruffalo deserves a golden globe but only for the pars where he is The Hulk.
Not enough love making, who are we without love?</div>",Negative
94,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.</div>",Negative
95,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THE RUSSO BROTHERS,,,,, After you did a terrible job of messing up the hulk in infinity war you then made it worst in endgame with nonsense professor hulk and to add insult to injury you also mess up thor,,,, you suck Russo Brothers,,,, you did such a fantastic job with the winter soldier and civil war two of my favorite movies,, what went wrong with endgame,,,,, you took two of the strongest and best avengers and turn one into a big slob and turn hulk into a big stupid teddy bear,,,,, seriously disappointed.</div>",Negative
96,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What the?......<br/><br/>how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?</div>",Negative
97,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Quite possibly the worst Avengers film in the series.
Plot holes in every single scene, bland and cold acting.
Sad really!</div>",Negative
98,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.</div>",Negative
99,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">And i did like the previous ones. The first part was also not so good but this one was empty .... i totally don't understand why many people did like it. The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...<br/><br/>Come on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off...</div>",Negative
100,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie.
Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line.</div>",Negative
101,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it.</div>",Negative
102,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie.
I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable.
As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad.</div>",Negative
103,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectives<br/><br/>this is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even ""fun stuff"" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad...</div>",Negative
104,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">They throw everything and the kitchen sink and it is boring.<br/><br/>The story is so convoluted and starts as a Telemundo famiiy drama before becoming a mess of coincidences. The superheroes play a 5-minute tag sequence at one point.<br/><br/>Sigh.<br/><br/>Thor with an axe!!! Thor playing earth 21st century video games and drinking beer. I have nothing more to say.</div>",Negative
105,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mild spoilers ahead:
This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good.</div>",Negative
106,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one.</div>",Negative
107,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )<br/><br/>PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !</div>",Negative
108,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.<br/><br/>The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.<br/><br/>Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama.</div>",Negative
109,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Before you embark on a journey to watch this way-too-long movie remember that the time spent doing this cannot be recovered. You will not be able to go back in time and undo this.
Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine. There is no depth, no cohesion to the story. I stopped watching it at 2h 15 min trying to save 45 minutes of my life.</div>",Negative
110,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War.
Endgame has lot of boring and cringy scenes, you really need to force yourself to watch it without skipping parts of it.
Especially the fact that these ""Superheroes"" are still crying every day after Thanos snap and cant build up a life again was annoying af.</div>",Negative
111,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you ignored the PC-stuff in the last movie, it was still a pretty enjoyable movie. But this? Nothing was coherent, it was too long, and it it wasn't until the very end that it delieved any decent action.</div>",Negative
112,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">More than 3h of ""yes sure..."" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it.</div>",Negative
113,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.</div>",Negative
114,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Except last 30 minutes, the whole movie is so lame. Bad writing. One of the worst movies Marvel ever made.</div>",Negative
115,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous</div>",Negative
116,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands? I would look on imdb, but the cast is so big I can't be bothered.</div>",Negative
117,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Infinity was one of the best films ever! This is a disgrace of a follow-up. Slow, elongated and boring. I sat through 1.5 hours and gave up, waiting for something to happen. My advice, do not bother!</div>",Negative
118,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Worst Marvel movie made. For those of you who gave it anything higher than a 3 are either knuckleheads or don't know anything about the Avengers. CGI was cool, only reason I gave a 3. All the hype of Cpt. Marvel and she is in the movie for 5 minutes. Worse than Infinity War, which also sucked. Movie made no sense.</div>",Negative
119,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow horrible weak Story..i feel like am watching epic movie and Meet the Spartans.......😒😒 don't waste your time watching this!</div>",Negative
120,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!</div>",Negative
121,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.</div>",Negative
122,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'd prefered seen dumbo !
I loved infinity war, but this one is so disapointing ! It's just à other movies of 33% Ironman, 32% captain america, 31% thor. And 4% for the rest of the bande without a good scenario or strory.
Characters are not treated properly
I feel used / stole my money. Captain Marvel is not in the movies at all. Even Thanos is so badly explain...</div>",Negative
123,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watched to see why so much hype. Audiences hear the hype and lose their minds. So dull. Downey is as always, or at least used to be, enigmatic. The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget.</div>",Negative
124,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Russo brothers use the Infinity War-created hype to deliver a bad, lazy, pockmarked, and contradictory script to the pillars they themselves had built at the beginning of this adventure.</div>",Negative
125,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finally it has come to an end. No idea whatsoever why I have watched these very merican action movies.
Do yourself a favour and watch paint dry instead.
The entire movie I was wondering: What the hell is going on now...
Maybe it could have saved the movie if they had cut down on the cost of the special effects and payed for a decent manuscript. Who knows.
Another thought... Why can anyone but Thor carry mjølner?
If anyone find these magic stones please undo this movie. Thanks.</div>",Negative
126,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Reaching for the stars, failed to take off from the orbit.</div>",Negative
127,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As we all know infinity war was so good and we all expected that endgame will be a movie higher than infinity war standards but it failed instead it was slow and depressing movie expect the last 30 mins of the movie.</div>",Negative
128,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A 3 hours Marvel film with 2.5 hours of drama, 15 mins of actions and 15 mins of something else.. seriously?<br/><br/>Their logic didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Besides, what they did to Thor was brutal.</div>",Negative
129,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously</div>",Negative
130,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.</div>",Negative
131,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine.</div>",Negative
132,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Short and to the point it was a lazy effort. Decimating beloved characters Thor and Hulk and using a weak ""Oceans 11"" plot to make it seem clever did not work. I watched it once and have yet to get over it.</div>",Negative
133,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When you see a movie with a 8.5 rating then it must be brilliant. Sadly not the case here. This movie is hugely overrated. I've seen all the previous movies and they have all been great and I understood them. This one I was scratching my head thinking what on earth is going on?
The plot was an incoherent ambling mess....too many characters, no flow or direction. This looked like a movie edited from bits of previous movies.
I'm surprised this is rated so highly....I'm very disappointed that this was a lazy movie....a waste of 3 hrs.</div>",Negative
134,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just a basic superhero movie. 3 hours but not much going on.</div>",Negative
135,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre.</div>",Negative
136,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing to say a pop corn movie, marvel must to create R category movie</div>",Negative
137,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">But sheep are watching this in droves....Avengers END-YAWN....... WTF?!?!?!<br/><br/>Boring as crap.<br/><br/>If they made 2 x 3 hour movies, it would still be boring as crap.<br/><br/>But, at least they humanised Thors depression....... although F-wit audiences think it's a joke.<br/><br/>morons watching moron movies.
Thank Christ to no more Robert Downey Trumpstick.</div>",Negative
138,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective.
This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce.
Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.<br/><br/>Not me!
I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest.</div>",Negative
139,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thor's take on ""the dude"" was the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Too long and sentimental<br/><br/>Most of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very exciting<br/><br/>I would wait to see this on video</div>",Negative
140,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was painful to watch this movie as it reached its conclusion. Great movies don't need a happy ending. Infinity War was a perfect example. Endgame, however, left me 10 times sadder. Sad, bored, annoyed and disappointed. No need to state the reasons, as many reviewers before me properly did that.<br/><br/>What amazes me though is how the Russos did a fantastic job with movies like The Winter Soldier or Infinity War and came up with this grotesque finale. I cannot conceive any reasonable explanation, other than Disney having a hidden malefic plan to slaughter great franchises (for Star Wars they decided to go with a slow painful process). Whatever it takes, right?</div>",Negative
141,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After two hours of absolutely nothing happening, I walked away. A complete and utter waste of time and money. How long do you expect me to wait for SOMETHING to happen?</div>",Negative
142,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had a heck of a time watching this movie. I usually like the Marvel films, but this one seems to fall in the pattern that I see way too often these days. At three hours, it is way too long. There is just not enough happening that is capable of sustaining interest in a 3 hour movie. Sometimes, less is more.</div>",Negative
143,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie.</div>",Negative
144,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved most of the first 22(?) films in the series. Endgame truly sucked. Decent acting, absolutely crap plot. I wish I'd never seen any of the film's in the series now.</div>",Negative
145,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you expect to watch a movie that is almost as good as Infinity Game then you will be very disappointed... A film that should be at most 90 minutes length it has been pushed at 180 minutes and they felt that time with lot of non-sense talking without action<br/><br/>Didn't worth the money spent to watch the movie, not even the time.. Even if I was offered to watch it again for free, I would pass the offer without any hesitation..</div>",Negative
146,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really enjoyed the prequel to this waste of my life(Infinity wars), the GOTG crew humour etc made it a fabulous balance.<br/><br/>This however had no soul, it drifted in and out of morose depression and self pity for the hopeless state everyone was in, this took up a good 2 hours.
Then an idiotic and predictable battle and i cheered when i could finally get up and leave. I need to find that glove so i can get 3 hours of my life back. Waste of time.</div>",Negative
147,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short.
X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies.</div>",Negative
148,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just didn't enjoy this as much as infinity war but not a huge marvel fan. Not sure why this is getting so much hype.</div>",Negative
149,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Pains me to write this review, towards one of my beloved franchises<br/><br/>The movie was BORING!!! When writers meet a block, they write about time machines, and really. that is where the movie flops. Before it even left the page to go on film
Lets sum up,
-1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel
-20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies
-30 minutes of SLOW boring ending<br/><br/>Dont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right....
This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise
Save your time, and money. Dont even rent this</div>",Negative
150,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After all these years THAT is what we get? A movie that makes no sense whatsoever, Because every time i try to figure something out about the movie another plothole appears.. X-Men3 The Last Stand is a masterpiece compared to Endgame and thats saying something!
3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman</div>",Negative
151,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So dissappointed. Was expecting a blast of a film. Cutting film time down by half hour/hour might have made it better. Only the last hour was ok, but expected much more with that also. Storyline not great either. Previous Avengers films much better. Such a shame. Waste of money really. Expectation I guess has earned its box office takings.</div>",Negative
152,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype.</div>",Negative
153,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Poor plot, dialogue and characterisation. Don't bother</div>",Negative
154,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Tremendous, it never ends and u always hope it's finishing</div>",Negative
155,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film.</div>",Negative
156,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12.</div>",Negative
157,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.</div>",Negative
158,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers Infinity Was by far one of the best of these types of movies but unfortunately the conclusion missed the mark by a long shot. It was slow, boring and the dialogue except for a few funny moments was just plain flat. Captain Marvel s appearance was just out of place and added nothing. We all knew what the story was going to be but to throw this at the audience was just plain lazy. .</div>",Negative
159,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How come so many people love this movie ? It was extremely boring, it was difficult to stay awake for three hours</div>",Negative
160,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible</div>",Negative
161,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess !
Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on!
Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with!
Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers!
3 stars given for the few laughs here and there , my favorite characters and 1 epic battle !</div>",Negative
162,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h.
If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.</div>",Negative
163,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild.</div>",Negative

165,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end.</div>",Negative
166,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!</div>",Negative

169,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible</div>",Negative
170,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess !
Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on!
Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with!
Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers!
3 stars given for the few laughs here and there , my favorite characters and 1 epic battle !</div>",Negative
171,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters.

If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.</div>",Negative
172,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild.</div>",Negative
173,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers Infinity Was by far one of the best of these types of movies but unfortunately the conclusion missed the mark by a long shot.

174,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12.</div>",Negative
175,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.</div>",Negative
176,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film.</div>",Negative

He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype.</div>",Negative

3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman</div>",Negative
181,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So dissappointed. Was expecting a blast of a film. Cutting film time down by half hour/hour might have made it better.

Lets sum up,
-1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel
-20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies
-30 minutes of SLOW boring ending<br/><br/>Dont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right....
This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise

241,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well! There are lots of good things about the film worth mentioning: VFX, lines, cinematography etc. Even the story itself was kind of good.
However, the film was overwhelmed with PC and diversity factors and principals. And because of that the film has no soul ... seems something missing or something was no right!
I am wondering if PC and Diversity ever stop ruining movies? It seems they won't stop unless they have already ruined and/or spoiled all the heroes we have had for decades.</div>",Negative

Anybody who thinks this colourful nonsense should be rated like actual movies with actual content is deluded.<br/><br/>Mindless escapism is fine. it just isn't art.</div>",Negative
244,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Overall a good movie, felt like Infinity War and two previous Avenger movies were better, not as rushed. There were many holes in the internal story for Endgame, could have been pushed out to two 2-hour movies to help fill in some questions.<br/><br/>In general I was pleased but without giving away spoilers and movie details it's a movie to check out for all fans and want a good 3-hr experience at the theatre.</div>",Negative
245,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This one puts drama at an unprecedented level. This is supposed to be a super-hero movie, not a soap opera. Too much story and the action only had 30 or so minutes. I wasted my money on this.</div>",Negative

The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie.

301,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.
It is the grande finale.</div>",Positive

331,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers Endgame is a perfect culmination of the 11 years of build up and 21 movies. In this movie they showcases us on how our main heroes dealt with the traumatizing event of Infinity War and how the cope and dealt this situation. I never ever cry in movies but my god, this one almost did. I won't give away anything, but the ending of 2 characters in this movie made me cry and put a smile on my face because of how right and perfect it is. This is by no means a perfect movie but it is a perfect ending. I gave it 10 Stars because of how I resonate with this film and how it ends the Marvel Cinematic Universe so perfectly.</div>",Positive
332,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Though I am not the biggest fan of Marvel movies, I can say without a doubt that this had the most epic finale in a movie ever. This was not a movie. This was an experience, an event. This was a fantastic end to a decade of generation-defining super hero movies. This was a movie to remember. Also, the credits were very touching (it may be a weird note, but they are great).<br/><br/>Though I will say this movie was a little too long, and Thanos felt a little less emotional real than he was in Infinity War. Also, it was very overwhelming in scope for such a long time, I was actually dizzy afterwards.</div>",Positive
333,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was a great ending to the arc of the franchise. Full of action some comedy and over all great production.</div>",Positive
334,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simple movie and weird.
End Game? Seriously? Looks like how "" End"" //</div>",Positive
335,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is no way to describe my emotions for that movie , Oh i love it very much , Best 3 hours in marvel's movie , I can't think that there is someone perfect for tony stark, Iron Man except Robert Downey Jr. he was in a great performance for their character and everyone was perfect I really love that movie but I will give it a 9.5/10 , I really loved infinity war more but this was an epic movie , part of the journey is the end , I love you 3000 Iron Man
Thank you Marvel (:</div>",Positive
336,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie starts with a recap of Infinity wars (Thanos' snap) and its aftermath but soon shifts to the real motive of the movie. The pace of the movie is perfect with emotional moments throughout. The characters are all well developed. The war scene gives you goosebumps; the theme music is awesome and the VFX freaking good. The ending will make you cry. I would definitely rewatch the movie!</div>",Positive
337,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a big fan of the MCU I knew I would enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize was how much more Endgame is than just an action movie! There were a LOT of laughs and many more tears than I was prepared for. It was long and overly dramatic in many parts but what a ride!!</div>",Positive

349,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D).

From beginning, middle and end I was always waiting for the next moment to occur with anxious breathing and nervous sweating because I truly wanted the heroes I have grown up watching to make it out alive. This movie is almost perfect and if you have not seen this movie yet or haven't seen the rest of the Marvel series yet (some how)! Then you must watch this movie A.S.A.P when you have time because movies like this are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see and it would be horrible if you missed out.

Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series.

After waiting for this movie to come to cinemas for a year I am happy to say that Endgame kept me on the edge of my seat from the get go. From beginning, middle and end I was always waiting for the next moment to occur with anxious breathing and nervous sweating because I truly wanted the heroes I have grown up watching to make it out alive. This movie is almost perfect and if you have not seen this movie yet or haven't seen the rest of the Marvel series yet (some how)! Then you must watch this movie A.S.A.P when you have time because movies like this are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see and it would be horrible if you missed out.

538,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan.

539,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D).

Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series.

636,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this and it gave me what I wanted without overblowing the movie with too many subplots. Other than the time travel aspect of the movie, even though any movie with time travel can be scrutinized it is a great film.</div>",Positive

642,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan.

643,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D).

644,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was obviously the best MCU film to date and im pretty sure everybody that saw this can agree. Without spoiling it there are some very sad moments but thats the most i can say. The whole story was great and it was just as good as any other great Marvel film. Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series.

After waiting for this movie to come to cinemas for a year I am happy to say that Endgame kept me on the edge of my seat from the get go. From beginning, middle and end I was always waiting for the next moment to occur with anxious breathing and nervous sweating because I truly wanted the heroes I have grown up watching to make it out alive. This movie is almost perfect and if you have not seen this movie yet or haven't seen the rest of the Marvel series yet (some how)! Then you must watch this movie A.S.A.P when you have time because movies like this are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see and it would be horrible if you missed out.

I was in the audience in 1977 opening weekend of Star Wars after a 3+ hour wait in line. What the Marvel team created here was nothing short of spectacular.

At first I asked myself do I want to sit through a 3 hour movie...? The answer was yes and boy am I happy with the results.

675,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Exhilarating, breathtaking culmination to the Infinity Saga delivers in every way.</div>",Positive
676,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That was the fantastic , amazing movie of their time</div>",Positive
677,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Though I am not the biggest fan of Marvel movies, I can say without a doubt that this had the most epic finale in a movie ever. This was not a movie. This was an experience, an event. This was a fantastic end to a decade of generation-defining super hero movies. This was a movie to remember. Also, the credits were very touching (it may be a weird note, but they are great).<br/><br/>Though I will say this movie was a little too long, and Thanos felt a little less emotional real than he was in Infinity War. Also, it was very overwhelming in scope for such a long time, I was actually dizzy afterwards.</div>",Positive
678,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was a great ending to the arc of the franchise. Full of action some comedy and over all great production.</div>",Positive
679,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simple movie and weird.
End Game? Seriously? Looks like how "" End"" //</div>",Positive
680,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is no way to describe my emotions for that movie , Oh i love it very much , Best 3 hours in marvel's movie , I can't think that there is someone perfect for tony stark, Iron Man except Robert Downey Jr. he was in a great performance for their character and everyone was perfect I really love that movie but I will give it a 9.5/10 , I really loved infinity war more but this was an epic movie , part of the journey is the end , I love you 3000 Iron Man
Thank you Marvel (:</div>",Positive
681,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie starts with a recap of Infinity wars (Thanos' snap) and its aftermath but soon shifts to the real motive of the movie. The pace of the movie is perfect with emotional moments throughout. The characters are all well developed. The war scene gives you goosebumps; the theme music is awesome and the VFX freaking good. The ending will make you cry. I would definitely rewatch the movie!</div>",Positive
682,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a big fan of the MCU I knew I would enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize was how much more Endgame is than just an action movie! There were a LOT of laughs and many more tears than I was prepared for. It was long and overly dramatic in many parts but what a ride!!</div>",Positive
683,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a great film, great emotion and realism that captivates for the duration of the long run time.</div>",Positive
684,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not perfect, but still one of the best action films I've ever seen (alongside Infinity Wars) and the only film I've watched twice at the cinema. In a word, epic.</div>",Positive
685,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Love it. Everything about it is amazing movie of the year</div>",Positive
686,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had intentions of what I wanted to see going into #avengersendgame, and after seeing the movie I was very pleased. The MCU knows how to bring the characters to life in a cinematic fashion that exceeded my expectations 100 times over. After investing so much in the characters for the 20 some odd movies I got emotional but a good a good emotional. I know realize why I got into film because I like telling stories that have heart. I give #avengersendgame a 9 and a half out of 10. Keep the MCU going bringing our childhood to life.</div>",Positive
687,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I liked how this movie pays tribute to all previous films either by showing similar scenes or dialogues</div>",Positive
688,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie awesome don't miss out especially for marvel fans . For general audience also this movie will give a fantastic experience, the core of the movie is the climax, this movie have a ultimate and emotional ending from other 22 marvel movies.</div>",Positive
689,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The CGI part is messy but the Avenger lovers would like it.</div>",Positive
690,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Avengers: Endgame"" is the eagerly awaited one, has a good amount of emotions in it, making you highly emotional in the final scenes.<br/><br/>It is very effective, though it takes momentum in the final hour, building the story in the first half.To read full click Here</div>",Positive
691,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I want to give it 10 stars but the fact that it has to force some political views (ex. The clearly forced all female Avenger scene) means it doesn't deserve a 10 star rating.</div>",Positive
692,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers Endgame is a perfect culmination of the 11 years of build up and 21 movies. In this movie they showcases us on how our main heroes dealt with the traumatizing event of Infinity War and how the cope and dealt this situation. I never ever cry in movies but my god, this one almost did. I won't give away anything, but the ending of 2 characters in this movie made me cry and put a smile on my face because of how right and perfect it is. This is by no means a perfect movie but it is a perfect ending. I gave it 10 Stars because of how I resonate with this film and how it ends the Marvel Cinematic Universe so perfectly.</div>",Positive
693,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans.</div>",Positive
694,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:<br/><br/>The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.</div>",Positive
695,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!</div>",Positive
696,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!</div>",Positive
697,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">And some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.</div>",Positive
698,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though).</div>",Positive
699,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!</div>",Positive
700,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history</div>",Positive
701,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">THE best movie series ever! So touching at the end but full of action during whole time. End of a great story!</div>",Positive
702,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Epic

704,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you say it's boring then it means that you don't understand the marvel story.It is 3 hours but it feel like 1 hour if you understand the concept.Of you say dark Phoenix means you like Xmen than the marvel phase 4</div>",Positive
705,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For many years I have been watching every story of Marvel, the last one with a lot of interest. There can't be a better ending. Thank you Marvel...</div>",Positive
706,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would have tweaked little things here and there but overall this film can only be described as Phenomenal.</div>",Positive
707,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The real movie was gr8. Best work ever done by marvels</div>",Positive
708,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch? Just to hear Cap say ""Avengers Assemble"" alone makes this epic...remember the question Mr. Hand asked his class when so many failed the test? This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display...</div>",Positive
709,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a beautiful film and worth watching and has a special artistic touch I swear.....
Reda El Alaoui</div>",Positive
710,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watched crying and over and over!<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies in the m marvel universe, I will never forget this movie.</div>",Positive
711,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You obviously didn't understand the film if you hate it.</div>",Positive
712,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2.
Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible.
Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ...
Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :)
I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ...
For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.</div>",Positive
713,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;)
To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!</div>",Positive
714,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.</div>",Positive
715,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic.</div>",Positive
716,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them</div>",Positive
717,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is very, very great and is the end of 10 years of a series of superheroes. Thanks Marvel</div>",Positive
718,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package</div>",Positive
719,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!</div>",Positive
720,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie.</div>",Positive
721,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Im happy to see finale like that , goodbye Avengers ;(</div>",Positive
722,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!</div>",Positive
723,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY.</div>",Positive
724,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories.</div>",Positive
725,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First Time i saw the movie in 3D. It was a great experience for me. It's awesome movie.
I'm a big fan of MCU.</div>",Positive
726,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">LITERALLY , one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life , filled with a tone of action and emotions . you will love avenger endgame . ' i love you 3000 '</div>",Positive
727,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen.</div>",Positive
728,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.<br/><br/>You will not he disappointed</div>",Positive
729,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I honestly can't understand how anybody could dislike this movie. It is without a doubt, one of the greatest films in history. Sure there were a few flaws, but no movie is perfect. From the character development to the action scenes to the comedy, it just succeeded all the expectations that it needed to.</div>",Positive
730,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film</div>",Positive
731,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.</div>",Positive
732,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!</div>",Positive
733,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like all those magic tricks out of from theirs hands and good teams against bad teams.</div>",Positive
734,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes.</div>",Positive
735,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you.</div>",Positive
736,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie i ever watch by Marvel production, i think they never gonna pass this movie. ALL RECOMMENDATION if you're fan of superheros</div>",Positive
737,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.</div>",Positive
738,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite the negative responses from people with low IQs this movie brought the epic final battle to life! Most of the dim witted comments come from people that have no idea that you have to get from point A to point B and build a story.</div>",Positive
739,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done.</div>",Positive
740,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will</div>",Positive
741,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.<br/><br/>9.4/10</div>",Positive
742,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.<br/><br/>For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all.
A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.<br/><br/>If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11.</div>",Positive
743,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Can't be over, I want more! I'll miss all of them together, fighting as one</div>",Positive
744,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional.

747,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU.

753,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also.
Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide.
Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie.

806,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched this for the second time, (first was in the theater) and wow, i cant Believe that this was 3 hours, its sooo good, it goes by so fast! i loveed every part ! all the throw backs to previous MCU movies, this movie manages to be the funniest and most heart breaking movie within the MCU. i don't have much thats bad to say... i did not like stan lees cameo, captain marvel is so blah, and besides that, its perfect!<br/><br/>i don't see any body who calls them self a Marvel fan could not enjoy this movie, that just blows my mind....</div>",Positive
807,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its perfection. ""I knew it !"" Its the best MCEU movie till date.</div>",Positive
808,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Best Movie of 2019 (so far!) It was full of twists!</div>",Positive
809,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!</div>",Positive

811,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't listen to all other bad reviews. This movie was amazing! A perfect ending to all other marvel movies we've seen in the last ten years. I've never sobbed and smiled this much ever since Titanic. Well done, Marvel. Well done.</div>",Positive
812,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece.
I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.</div>",Positive
813,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...</div>",Positive
814,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.</div>",Positive
815,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!</div>",Positive
816,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!</div>",Positive
817,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.</div>",Positive
818,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""</div>",Positive
819,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years</div>",Positive
820,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤</div>",Positive
821,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.<br/><br/>This is how you end the film<br/><br/>Beautiful, impactful, amazing</div>",Positive

823,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cant imagine that i could ever see this amazing movie, its a three hours movie but it only feels like one hour! Every scene has its own characteristic that makes this movie very good!</div>",Positive

830,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Visuals, plot, intelligence, emotions, with great acting ....what else do you want in a movie. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given their best with positive results. The INFINITY SAGA ends.</div>",Positive
831,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.</div>",Positive
832,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time.</div>",Positive
833,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie that combined 6 different movie timeline.....</div>",Positive
834,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not over for cap and ironman. With hulk rebuilt the time machine they can go back in time for them all they need is more of pimms formula. Let's continue the franchise for the fans.</div>",Positive
835,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best action movie i have seen in my life at no point of it's 3 HOUR runtime was I not interested and at times where the fight scenes were happening I was really pumped and my arm was unironically shacking from all of enjoyment i was having, I remeber laughing alot too at the very funny jokes in the movie.</div>",Positive
836,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie it was great. The beginning was a bit weak but further into the film it got better and better. I even cried, 3 hours of fun and emotional twists, the Jokes were good they where timed good and they were fun, it really added more sympathy to the characters.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 this is a must see</div>",Positive

841,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best marvel movie till date ... simply an epic I mean it is an epic.</div>",Positive
842,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think it's the best avengers film and Doctor Strange's return was so awesome, it's really good movie</div>",Positive
843,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think this movie is even better than infinity war! It feels balanced (as all things should be!) and you really feel a connection with the characters. It also has a lot of humour.</div>",Positive
844,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Anyone who complains about this film has not appreciated the last 10+ years of Marvel cinematic creation. Apparently everyone is a ""genius"" and those that have been working on these movies for this long are idiots. This was the best and most perfect way to end the Infinity War Saga. They blew everything out of the water and delivered exactly what fans needed and wished for. Those that apparently have been writing movies from their couches fo their entire lives while sipping on mama's kool aid need to check themselves. What blows my mind more than the movie is the fact that there are actually people griping about it and finding every reason to whine and moan about something that you never could dictate - so why bother wasting so much time? It was good. It may end up being the highest grossing film of all time. That says enough.</div>",Positive
845,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, I never really got into MCU movies but after watching this I've been obsessed</div>",Positive
846,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well i loved the movie. I didn't even knew when did the three hour time passed because i was enjoying a lot.

848,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes I reviewed this already but people giving this movie less than 9 obviously aren't vested in these characters and are just to anti marvel to see just how good this movie was..... as far as being any kind realistic the movie starts with dear Mr fantasy.....</div>",Positive
849,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My boyfriend truly loves anything Marvel. I would usually pass on watching any robot or superhero movie but I had the chance to watch Infinity Wars. OMG! I was hooked and so we went to see Endgame. I have now doubled back to watch all of the prior films I missed so I understand each character. I am now a true fan of Marvel. Jus how much of a fan you might ask------I cried about Tony Starks.</div>",Positive

852,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie it was great. The beginning was a bit weak but further into the film it got better and better.

855,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not over for cap and ironman. With hulk rebuilt the time machine they can go back in time for them all they need is more of pimms formula. Let's continue the franchise for the fans.</div>",Positive
856,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.</div>",Positive
857,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time.</div>",Positive
858,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Visuals, plot, intelligence, emotions, with great acting ....what else do you want in a movie. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given their best with positive results. The INFINITY SAGA ends.</div>",Positive
859,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yyyeeesssss that's the marvel movie that we need just grat and brilliant!</div>",Positive

861,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This ties everything into a perfect little bow but this us not the end of MCU</div>",Positive
862,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I hope The whole world get to watch it, its a Game Changer Not Alike Any Ever Done</div>",Positive
863,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie ever nothing can or will beat avengers endgame</div>",Positive
864,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cant imagine that i could ever see this amazing movie, its a three hours movie but it only feels like one hour! Every scene has its own characteristic that makes this movie very good!</div>",Positive
865,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I truly like this movie than before. Their fighting are memorable. 10 points for this amazing movie!!</div>",Positive
866,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love this the full avengers and marvel is my favourite and I made stormbreaker infinity gaunlet Spiderman web shooters Dr strange eye if agomoto and Captain America's shield I am a biggest fan of marvel</div>",Positive
867,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.<br/><br/>This is how you end the film<br/><br/>Beautiful, impactful, amazing</div>",Positive
868,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤</div>",Positive
869,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years</div>",Positive
870,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""</div>",Positive
871,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.</div>",Positive
872,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!</div>",Positive
873,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!</div>",Positive
874,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.</div>",Positive
875,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...</div>",Positive
876,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece.
I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.</div>",Positive
877,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't listen to all other bad reviews. This movie was amazing! A perfect ending to all other marvel movies we've seen in the last ten years. I've never sobbed and smiled this much ever since Titanic. Well done, Marvel. Well done.</div>",Positive
878,"<div class=""text show-more__control""><ul><li>great performances</li><li>incredible visuals</li><li>story ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/characters</li><li>perfect send off for the original actors</li><li>a must see for any marvel or superhero fan</li></ul></div>",Positive
879,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!</div>",Positive

They blew everything out of the water and delivered exactly what fans needed and wished for. Those that apparently have been writing movies from their couches fo their entire lives while sipping on mama's kool aid need to check themselves. What blows my mind more than the movie is the fact that there are actually people griping about it and finding every reason to whine and moan about something that you never could dictate - so why bother wasting so much time? It was good. It may end up being the highest grossing film of all time. That says enough.</div>",Positive

1028,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤</div>",Positive
1029,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years</div>",Positive
1030,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""</div>",Positive
1031,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.</div>",Positive
1032,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!</div>",Positive
1033,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!</div>",Positive
1034,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.</div>",Positive
1035,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...</div>",Positive
1036,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece.
I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.</div>",Positive
1037,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't listen to all other bad reviews. This movie was amazing! A perfect ending to all other marvel movies we've seen in the last ten years. I've never sobbed and smiled this much ever since Titanic. Well done, Marvel. Well done.</div>",Positive
1038,"<div class=""text show-more__control""><ul><li>great performances</li><li>incredible visuals</li><li>story ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/characters</li><li>perfect send off for the original actors</li><li>a must see for any marvel or superhero fan</li></ul></div>",Positive
1039,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!</div>",Positive
1040,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Best Movie of 2019 (so far!) It was full of twists!</div>",Positive
1041,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its perfection. ""I knew it !"" Its the best MCEU movie till date.</div>",Positive
1042,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched this for the second time, (first was in the theater) and wow, i cant Believe that this was 3 hours, its sooo good, it goes by so fast! i loveed every part ! all the throw backs to previous MCU movies, this movie manages to be the funniest and most heart breaking movie within the MCU. i don't have much thats bad to say... i did not like stan lees cameo, captain marvel is so blah, and besides that, its perfect!<br/><br/>i don't see any body who calls them self a Marvel fan could not enjoy this movie, that just blows my mind....</div>",Positive
1043,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you are even a remote fan of this universe you must watch this!</div>",Positive
1044,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thanks marvel for this amazing ride and the perfect ending</div>",Positive
1045,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is fun. Nerding out about the massive 23 film undertaking is fun. The storyline is fun. The character evolutions are fun.<br/><br/>End Game is an amazing addition to an already epic collection of movies. Duck the haterz 🦆</div>",Positive
1046,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Rating 10/10
Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic &amp; perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!</div>",Positive
1047,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far.</div>",Positive
1048,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!!
I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee.</div>",Positive
1049,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also.
Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide.
Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie.
Feeling Sad for RDJ... 😭😭😭</div>",Positive
1050,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It perfectly concluded the movies I have been watching from the beginning. Acting was amazing, story was spectacular, and even though it was darker than most marvel movies, they still incorporated light-hearted comedy.</div>",Positive
1051,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I absolutely loved this film. It was wonderful. The CGI, the special effects, the character building, the emotional intensity, and the music are all absolutely amazing. One of my favourite movies ever</div>",Positive
1052,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.<br/><br/>9.4/10</div>",Positive
1053,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.<br/><br/>For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all.
A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.<br/><br/>If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11.</div>",Positive
1054,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Can't be over, I want more! I'll miss all of them together, fighting as one</div>",Positive
1055,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.</div>",Positive
1056,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thanx Marvel for doing such art and make it exists.</div>",Positive
1057,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We know this most best selling movie of all time... im already watching this movie more than 2 time... and never get bored</div>",Positive
1058,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!</div>",Positive
1059,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22.
A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!</div>",Positive
1060,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved it so much, just can't see a story with so much depth getting better.</div>",Positive
1061,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos.</div>",Positive
1062,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will</div>",Positive
1063,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done.</div>",Positive
1064,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film</div>",Positive
1065,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.</div>",Positive
1066,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!</div>",Positive
1067,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like all those magic tricks out of from theirs hands and good teams against bad teams.</div>",Positive
1068,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes.</div>",Positive
1069,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you.</div>",Positive
1070,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie i ever watch by Marvel production, i think they never gonna pass this movie. ALL RECOMMENDATION if you're fan of superheros</div>",Positive
1071,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.</div>",Positive
1072,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite the negative responses from people with low IQs this movie brought the epic final battle to life! Most of the dim witted comments come from people that have no idea that you have to get from point A to point B and build a story.</div>",Positive
1073,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I honestly can't understand how anybody could dislike this movie. It is without a doubt, one of the greatest films in history.

1078,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!</div>",Positive
1079,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had.

1080,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Im happy to see finale like that , goodbye Avengers ;(</div>",Positive
1081,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!</div>",Positive
1082,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY.</div>",Positive
1083,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories.</div>",Positive
1084,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch?

This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display...</div>",Positive

1087,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You obviously didn't understand the film if you hate it.</div>",Positive
1088,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2.
Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible.
Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ...
Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :)
I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ...
For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.</div>",Positive
1089,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;)
To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!</div>",Positive
1090,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot.

Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.</div>",Positive
1091,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic.</div>",Positive

I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history</div>",Positive
1145,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!</div>",Positive

1147,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though).</div>",Positive
1148,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!</div>",Positive
1149,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!</div>",Positive
1150,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:<br/><br/>The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.</div>",Positive
