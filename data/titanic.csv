0,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Hand it to Cameron for making a film full of historical inaccuracy that would appeal to the largest of American audiences. Now future generations will always believe that Picasso painted cubist works in 1914, and that turn-of-the-century folk commonly said ""s**t"" and flipped the bird. Sure, it's visually appealing, but the script reads like it was written on the back of cocktail napkins. I haven't seen such idiotic tripe since ""Braveheart"". My thanks to the garbage people of America for making a success of this 200 million dollar film concerned with 'class struggle'. The liberal filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank.</div>",Negative
1,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nice movie, superb directing, excellent effects, good enough acting(Kate was OK, Leo is the best actor among those least talented beautiful people). An empty script specially designed to show off its special effects. That sums up the most overrated film in history. I will resist commenting on the overplayed soundtrack.<br/><br/>Love lovin schoolgirls and horny boys who enjoy goggling at Kate will certainly adore it. The Oscar judges are probably retired businessmen who know nothing about movies. Heard they rarely accept female members(chauvinist they are) into the panel of Oscar judges. Thus they rate Titanic as best pic, under pressure of their junior school daughters.</div>",Negative
2,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went into this movie knowing what to expect.  A long movie, with lots of special effects, and lots of action and romance.  But I never thought I'd see such terrible acting, such terrible scriptwriting, and such terribly developed characters in this highly praised winner of several Academy Awards.  Hollywood has turned to sensationalism, which isn't in itself bad, but it has turned its back on creativity.  What really was great about this movie?  Did it NEED to exist?  Movies like Citizen Kane, or Ran, or Amadeus are movies that rejoice in the possibilities of human creativity.  James Cameron made a movie that was filmed superbly with excellent special effects, but it is the product of money, not spirit.  And in our confused world of today, the last thing we need is a fake Messiah dressed in glittering gold.</div>",Negative
3,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie keeps giving eye ligma whenever I watch it. My eyes lite on fire because of how horrifying it is.</div>",Negative
4,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What is so great about this movie that it made so much money? We will never know. But all the hype about the real Titanic during that time sure helped it. But looking behind the hype and the historical reference, what do we have, really? Just another fictional love story between two characters that nobody could identify with. C'mon, if it were a story of my real life, I wouldn't want DiCapprio to star in it. He is a one dimensional actor with no real talent, just a ""pretty face"" which only a teenage girl or a confused homo would fall in love with. The other actors were too transparent and unreal. James Cameron was smart using such a clever background and special effects. I've seen it only once in video to see what was all about and fell asleep thru the first 21/2 hours of it. The only good scenes were the sinking of the ship. Why such a crappy movie made so much money? I ill never know but it tells me a lot of the 'American way of life' here. An Oscar for that? Where were L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, Amistad? British controlled Oscar Board of Directors...bah!</div>",Negative
5,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">OK I was forced. I should not have submitted and realised the messenger spoke with forked tounge. Expletives of animal toilet habits will not suffice. James Cameron if you read this, please be aware that THIS is junk. Aliens 2 was great but this takes the cake in sick inducing nonsense. In a historical retelling even U571 pulled it off better and they brazenly lied. Nope sorry if Ihad a choice between watching this again and malaria the malaria will win hands down. Billy Zane HOW COULD YOU!</div>",Negative
6,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was way too long! I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio do better acting when he was a kid on ""Growing Pains."" There were so many unbelievable plots in this movie. Why would people bring guns on a ship and shoot people. There are so many unanswered questions in this movie. Why were the rich people so mean and snobby? This movie won eleven Oscars? 1997 must have been a very bad year for movies. Who did the extensive research for this movie? How do they know what happened on the Titanic? Very few people (if any) that were on that ship are alive today. Most of the actors did a very good job. However,  I haven't seen many of them in other movies. The ship did look luxurious for 1912.</div>",Negative
7,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finally saw the movie completely. Never again I want my time back. I prefer to watch The Poseidon Adventure a 1,000 time before sit and watch this again.</div>",Negative
8,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is an excellent movie if you are trying to go to sleep.  The real ship took much less than three hours to sink.  Why suffer through over three and a half in a remake.  The movie travels slow and seems to take forever to get to the next scene.  So much of the dialoge has nothing to do with the plot line of the movie, and the rest of it just repeats what the audience already knows.  The love story is very typical of every movie and offers no difference to any other love story out of Hollywood these days.  It has a very cookie cutter story line.  As for the acting of DiCaprio, if his character was supposed to be so sappy and pathetic you just wanted to pull him out of the movie and give him a good flogging, then he did a wonderful job.  However, I seriously doubt that it was intentional in any way.</div>",Negative
9,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is by far, the most over-rated movie of all time. It won something like 13 Academy Awards simply based on box office grosses. How do I know this, because it came out the same year as LA Confidential, one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. The set design and direction of Titanic are actually very good. Well the set design is AMAZING. However the acting is so bad, it makes me wonder how Leonardo Dicaprio was ever a good actor(The Basketball Diaries, What's Eating Gilbert Grape). Kate Winslet wasn't bad, but surely over-rated. Billy Zane plays a cartoon villain very poorly, not that he ever proved he was a good actor(The Phantom?). And the rest of the cast is just blah. I still can't get past the fact that people really believe this is one of the great ones. Maybe after the teeny boppers that gave this movie 614 billion dollars grow up and see more movies, they'll realize that this is an overall mediocre movie.</div>",Negative
10,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just cried and cried and cried and cried. It was so romantic and moving. Yes. And that lovely, lovely, lovely theme music. It is Mozartian. Every time I hear it in a lift, or in a bar, it makes me weep. My life will never be the same.<br/><br/>James Cameron, you are the Shakespeare of the cinema.</div>",Negative
11,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't get it, why would anyone spend time to watch this movie over and over and over and over again? My girl friend watched this movie for 3 times. MY GOD, in theater!! it drove me mad.<br/><br/>This movie, is boring, dumb, and irrational. why would a rich girl fell for a poor theif? It just doesn't make any sense.</div>",Negative
12,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The special affects were awesome! The acting and script were a disgrace. Sort of a juvenile Stalinist propoganda piece. Watch ""A Night To Remember"",1958, to see a GREAT movie about the Titanic, a movie suitable for those older than age twelve.</div>",Negative
13,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In my top 3 worst 3 films of all time, just beating King Ralph into 3rd. If i were you, i would take yourself outside, rub a cheese grater on the side of your face for 3 hours then come back inside.  Believe me, you will of had much more fun....</div>",Negative
14,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let's sink this ship right now.  It's over, baby, there's nothing left! This is a BAD movie.  I'm not saying there's any harm in enjoying a bad movie, but some of you people have taken it too far.  Epic?  Greatest movie of all time?  Deserving of 11 Oscars?  I SPIT on the ground all of you people who have seen it five, six, seven times walk on.  Bad script + ridiculous acting + egotistical chucklehead director = PIECE OF FILTH MOVIE. I love watching piece of filth movies as much as the next guy, but all of you people with your Leo posters and your Titanic t-shirts and your Greatest Movie of All Time attitudes have driven me and others with even half a bit of common sense to HATE and LOATHE this ""movie.""  I no longer hold this little travesty in any higher regard than I hold ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers,"" no offense to the ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" people.</div>",Negative
15,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had so much potential and yet it was wasted. It was wasted on a pointless, made-up love story that only prepubescent teens and emotionally immature adults would enjoy. It's completely disrespectful to the actual tragedy and it's victims. Just because the movie made a lot of money does not reflect the quality of it. Someone should redo the film without a James Cameron or Michael Bay perspective.</div>",Negative
16,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay, so why didn't they take advantage of the fact that Satan was on board the ship.  Did he cause the iceberg to appear?  I mean that's who Billy Zane was playing right?  The devil.  Because, after all, only Amon Goeth from Schindler's List in recent history is more of a despicable character in a movie.  He had absolutely no redeeming qualities which leads me to question why a girl supposedly as smart and emancipated as Rose would have anything at all to do with him. I just completely fail to understand the appeal of this movie.  Stock characters, stock situation--2200 people on board the ship and this was the best story Cameron could come up with??  The effects were cheesy and then he throws in tearjerking scenes of people dying that we never got to know as a way of making us feel sad.  You want to see a really romantic movie?  Rent The English Patient.</div>",Negative
17,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is absolute garbage from beginning to end. I lost all respect for James Cameron after this. I can't believe anyone would rate this movie high. At least 3000+ people with sense (including myself) have rated this as 1 (awful). A trite story, bad acting, a bad script, and a horrible performance from DiCraprio and Winslet. To those who accuse people who rate Titanic low of not rating this movie ""honestly"" I question whether you have rated this movie honestly. If people were honest with themselves and weren't drawn in by the hype of this movie, they would rate this no higher than a 6. By the way-the MPAA rated this a PG-13. Female frontal nudity! Hello!!! Did the person who rated this take a bathroom break during the part when Kate took her clothes off? Granted, Kate Winslet nude is about as attractive as that ugly nude granny in ""The Shining."" At least they still had enough sense in the 70s to give that one an ""R"" rating.</div>",Negative
18,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perhaps my expectations ran too high when I watched this movie, but I'm rather inclined to think that this is the most overrated movie that's ever been made. Although the historical facts are of course known, the story holds no surprises at all and the characters are full of clichés which makes it really hard to watch the whole movie without being lulled to sleep or bored to death. Of course, it's a very emotional film with a romantic love story, but the lovers stay two-dimensional unless you happen to be a true Leonardo-di-Caprio-fan, and as I haven't been one before, I certainly won't be one now. As to the ship's sinking itself, which is what the average viewer might have paid for to watch, it's probably impressive and satisfying for most viewers, but I think it is reaching our lowest instincts by satisfying our greed to watch catastrophes from a safe distance, e.g. your living-room or local theater, and gladness it's not us who are fighting for life. Unfortunately, there's really no more than that to the film, so if you haven't seen the movie before, keep your money and find something worth while doing.</div>",Negative
19,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At least not as bad as The English Patient but pretty much right there. Go see a real love story like The Lobster instead of this trash.</div>",Negative
20,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bloated, syrupy disappointment.  Even the special effects were bad.  It was painfully obvious every time they ""went digital"".  Took me right out of the movie each time.  Watching little digitized people fall down the screen....what entertainment.  I rather play ""Pong"".</div>",Negative
21,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is an awful movie. Why? Many reasons. Kate Winslet is a good actress, however Leo and the rest of the cast is just pathetic. Second, this tries and fails to be a period piece. Its not, there are too many inaccuracies to even begin to go into, this is a Hollywood piece, not a period movie. <br/><br/>If you are an ignorant white suburban female, you'll cream your pants for this movie because you are n ignorant white suburban female. The ability of this movie to have that reaction makes it a stupid, terrible film, not a good film. Titanic is a really awful movie. I wish James Cameron and Kirk Cameron would get married.</div>",Negative
22,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">...ruined what could have been a very good film.  Every time we are drawn into the mood we are forced out with a ridiculous statement from one of the characters.  The best such example is when Jack and Rose are together reaching to hold on to the railing in what could have been a beautiful, symbolic moment, but no, Rose says ""this is where we first met"" in a cheesy little voice.  Moment gone - killed by stating the obvious.</div>",Negative
23,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What's there in this movie... to make it deserve 11 oscars ???<br/><br/>I mean... it has grand sets, great soundtrack... so those awards r ok... but then 11 oscars... ??</div>",Negative
24,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A good movie, but whoever made up this story did not try to make it the least bit believable. Who would actually believe that ""the worlds biggest ship"" would sink because it hit an iceberg, it's just not realistic. And the name ""Titanic"" what does that even mean, what idiot thought it was a fitting name for a giant fictional ship. All around just a bad movie and too long.</div>",Negative
25,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you are thinking of watching this film, i have a suggestion.Take a spoon and gauge out your eyes then get a fork and stab into your brain. One of the WORST films ever made.Only Hobgoblins,Troll and Death wish 4 are worse.Utter S*&amp;T</div>",Negative
26,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is probably the worst film I have ever seen. The plot lacks direction. The film is too long. The acting is poor. It's too slow. It's pathetic. However, all the girls I know love the film, they say its brilliant, perfect, etc etc.<br/><br/>My advice, if you are female, go watch it. If you male, do anything to avoid seeing it. Out of ten, I give it zero. But then thats from a male point of view.....</div>",Negative
27,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">...oh, and a ship sinks.<br/><br/>Impossible to watch in a single sitting</div>",Negative
28,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Aside from being widely historically inaccurate (the whole ""Are there enough lifeboats?"" thing--nobody asked that question on that ship, numerous other flukes), the film was horribly written and badly acted. Depended too heavily on Leonardo DeCaprio's brief rise to superstardom among 13 year old girls (whatever happened to that guy?). But it won a buccoo amount of Oscars, and this is just my opinion. But still, the sheer naive sense of it detracts from the entire film. --Bud Sturguess, Texas</div>",Negative
29,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Looking at other viewers' comments, I see someone called this ""the greatest motion picture of all time"". . . in capitals, no less.  Although I wish I had Rose's wardrobe hanging in my closet, and I thought the detail was exquisite, I have to firmly disagree.  The script of this film is one of the dullest, sappiest, and most uninspired I have seen. While Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are both talented thespians, these cardboard characters leave them few options.  The patter between Jack and Rose (""Do you trust me?"" ""I trust you!"" ""You have to trust me, Rose!"" etc.) and the melodrama made the length of the film unbearable.  I have heard this film referred to as ""epic.""  If you want to see  a real epic, rent Lawrence of Arabia instead.  It knocks the socks off of Titanic--real acting, believeable gunplay, taught emotionalism and a powerhouse performance by the incomparable Peter O'Toole.</div>",Negative
30,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best part of the movie had to be when Leo went under the water at the end!! I dont have anything in particular against him as an actor and i think he was great in basketball diaries but this film was terrible and there was no excuse for the terrible acting within!!</div>",Negative
31,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't understand why this movie is so big. Was the American public asking itself ""Well I love cliched tragic love stories, and I love cliched stories with lots of WATER in them, why can't they combine the cliches of tragic love and water into one bloated, overblown blockbuster?""<br/><br/>I myself never pondered this question, and thus I did not enjoy Titanic.</div>",Negative
32,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have waited three years to see this movie and finally obtained a video for £2.  I'm glad I didn't invest more.  The acting from the leading pair is as awful as it can get.  The script is absolutely horrific.  Effects and music earn accolades as do some of the supporting cast.  The mystery is why was this film so big a blockbuster?  Maybe with proper actors......</div>",Negative
33,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cameron's alleged masterpiece has two things going for it: amazing digital effects and the fact that the vessel broke in half.<br/><br/>Dozens of excellent real-life stories are abandoned for an an insipid love story.<br/><br/>See the excellent ""A Night To Remember"" instead.<br/><br/>0 of 4 Niro~Stars</div>",Negative
34,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It pains me that this is the top grossing film of all-time and I'm shocked at the lead it has over second place.  It was awful.  The music was terrible.  The plot was terrible (it's fiction, remember?).  The acting was terrible.  Leo is just not believable as the leading man, in my opinion. It's entirely too long.  I will grant that the sets were fantastic.<br/><br/>But then, I don't like Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" either.</div>",Negative
35,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie twice.  I'll admit that.  However I got over the whole thing.  The dialogue is too 90's, the acting good but not Oscar caliber. The main thing that makes this movie are the fx, atmosphere, and set decoration.  Other than that this movie doesn't really have that much to offer.  Why didn't LA Confidential win best picture?  Also, doesn't James Horner's score sound recycled from Braveheart?  This movie is not as great as 15 year old girls make it out to be.</div>",Negative
36,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So much money spent for nothing. There's nothing special about that piece of crap. Nothing innovative, nothing really interesting. Plain, old, stupid-as-hell, trivial, boring love story. A well-tested money-collecting formula, product in a shiny package. Nothing else. Shame on James Cameron for bringing such a mess into the world.<br/><br/>What did you people see here that is worth 600 mln. dolars? 0/10 ...and remember people the phrase ""I shop therefore I am."" That's all this movie is about.</div>",Negative
37,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like really, really bad acting, then this enormously boring film is just the film for you! The plot is tedious and obvious. The film technique makes it difficult to tell what the special effects are - this is achieved by making everything look as if it is a badly executed special effect. You could cut two and a half hours from this film and, though it still wouldn't be any good, it would be a lot less bad.</div>",Negative
38,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this is an extremely trite, and boring movie. the acting was much too melodramatic, and although it had astounding special effects, i can not believe that they marketed it so much to the point where there was no escaping from it. the terrible marketing, made a bad movie worse, and i have only seen it once, jan 11, 2000 it was my first --and last-- time watching a movie where i sit through 3 hours of bad acting and then watch the boat sink. terrible and highly over-rated.</div>",Negative
39,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Waited as long as possible before watching this thing to let the public fanfare fade away, then one night, fell exhausted on ye olde couch with naught else to view... &amp; phew...it was far worse even than expected. Where to start? Acting? Where? Corny? Hey, Iowa aint got this much in a year. Shallow? A nickel couldn't have sunk in this thing. One word summation? EMBARRASSING. Ironic that Heavens Gate was same kind of film but beautifully made &amp; was an all-time disaster, whereas this pig was a big hit. Ah well, god bless the new economy &amp; remember PT Barnum.</div>",Negative
40,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film had good effects for a movie created in 1997. This is the only reason why it is worth watching. Once again, Hollywood does its best at taking a terrible tragedy and turning it around to be a love story. You either liked this movie for its effects and love story or you hated because of its depiction. Fist Titanic, then pearl harbor. Next, it will be on 9/11. I would like to see how America responds to a 9/11 love story. Trust me, they will do it within a few years. If you are deep into the events of titanic, it would probably be a good movie to watch. other than that, keep walking down the movie shelves.<br/><br/>later.</div>",Negative
41,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it. The ship was the only thing really impressive and Kate winsletts boobs. But Leonardo Dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie. The love story is pathetic. The sinking of the boat is also quite impressive. But Pearl Harbor has much better effects than this. This movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards.</div>",Negative
42,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is so egregious, I sometimes wonder if it wasn't constructed to be campy on purpose a la a John Waters film.  The dialogue is beyond cheesy, and the scene where Kate Winslet spit on Billy Zane is like something out of a grade-Z soap opera.  I didn't believe a second of this film - it is extraordinarily fake in every respect. Even the special effects are bad (even a blind man could tell that the ship is computer generated), which is especially pathetic given the bloated budget.  DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!</div>",Negative
43,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, I have seen this film, and it was a plastic-pathetic semi-lovestory. The only things worth seeing are the computer animations, but I've seen better i more low-budget movies. The three hours the film lasts seem to go on forever and ever. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go and see it, you'll just loose three hours of your life you could spend picking your teeth or anything that's more interesting.</div>",Negative
44,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I checked and I was right. This film did not win any American or British Academy Awards for ACTING! (the main purpose for a film right?) It didn't win any Golden Globes for acting either. The reason is simple. This film was terrible. The writing was bad and the the performers were worse. For all the awards this trash did win, nobody with any clout gave the actors anything. Leo didn't even get a nomination! The ship sank, and people died because a big company traded lives for profit. This story is nothing new and it has been told many times before in much better films of the same name.<br/><br/>This is 3 plus hours of my life I will never get back.</div>",Negative
45,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this movie is awful. its only good because leo dies and the special effects are decent but just because it did really well at the box office because 100 teenage girls saw it 10,000 times, so i have to say it was horrible. the story was awful and i just wanted to see the effects, they didnt need to waste the first video on their ""love"" over the course of a month... what garbage</div>",Negative
46,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yeah, you heard me. The worst Star Trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage. It is a disaster flick. Nothing more. Acting is horrible, with exception of Billy Zane who is able to do a decent job. The special effects are the only thing going for this film. I normally enjoy movies from James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator) but I found this to be horrible. And by the way, DiCaprio can't act and that's why he didn't get an Oscar for this slop. Avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value.</div>",Negative
47,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am sorry, but I believe that this film was way over rated. It was too long , and really put myself to sleep. To really put it simple- the boat sank, get over it. :)</div>",Negative
48,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought this movie extremely disappointing. The characters were not very motivating, and the acting was horrible.  I was not convinced of their roles at all.  The story line was also very poor and unrealistic.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, instead I suggest the older version made in 1953. Although it isn't recent, the story is very moving and the ending quite touching.</div>",Negative
49,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don´t know what idea of great movies does the Academy have. Movies like this one are about the same soap opera story that we have always seen in TV for years, with the only difference of good special effects. Nothing else. The Oscar shouldn´t be given to movies like this, but to innovative way to tell stories. And Titanic, for sure, is not one of those.</div>",Negative
50,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bad script, with a plot patched together from the earlier Titanic films. Bad performances.  Special effects unimpressive.  Sets no better than the ones in the far superior ""A Night to Remember"".  A theme song capable of stripping the enamel off your teeth.  This movie sucks.  One can only conclude that anyone who really loves films will hate it.</div>",Negative
51,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only thing I got from this movie was a frightful headache...They could've made it one tape and it would've been good but they had to drag the stupid story(Which wasn't much of one)out! Watch the first tape..but forget the last one!It's really not worth the headache You'll more than likely get! The stupid flashing lights really get to you after the first time you see them..But after the second You want to scream... And then they have to drag the sinking ship out for one whole tape..really a dumb movie and I don't know why everyone raved about it unless they liked staring at Kate's boobs...Thats the only thing I can figure...And the old women was really stupid... Leo's acting really stunk...And it seems to me they couldn't make up their mind on the millionares role in the whole dumb movie....If he so cared about himself he would've forgot about the slut and left... Really a stupid movie...One word describes it well...DUMB!!!</div>",Negative
52,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As much as I wish I could hide the fact that I saw this...thing...that passed for a movie, I just can't.  Titanic proved that James Cameron should never try a movie with depth or plot, or a good script, because this effort failed miserably.  It will be a cold day in hell before I EVER admit this movie deserved any of the Academy Awards it got, especially considering it's competition.  L.A. Confidential-one of the best movies ever.  Good Will Hunting-an excellent movie.  As Good As It Gets-very funny and well written. Titanic-a boat.  The awards it got are the reasons that I no longer respect the Academy of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences.  Anyone who thinks that the lead actors in this movie were good, well, all I can say is, especially if you're a guy, I feel sorry for you.  An un-original story, poor poorly acted, and far beyond any reasonable budget, the success of this movie really is beyond me.  I don't think it would hurt Mr. James 'I'm King Of the World' Cameron to refund my matinee ticket price.</div>",Negative

58,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it. The ship was the only thing really impressive and Kate winsletts boobs. But Leonardo Dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie. The love story is pathetic. The sinking of the boat is also quite impressive. But Pearl Harbor has much better effects than this. This movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards.</div>",Negative
59,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is so egregious, I sometimes wonder if it wasn't constructed to be campy on purpose a la a John Waters film.  The dialogue is beyond cheesy, and the scene where Kate Winslet spit on Billy Zane is like something out of a grade-Z soap opera.  I didn't believe a second of this film - it is extraordinarily fake in every respect. Even the special effects are bad (even a blind man could tell that the ship is computer generated), which is especially pathetic given the bloated budget.  DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!</div>",Negative
60,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie twice.  I'll admit that.  However I got over the whole thing.  The dialogue is too 90's, the acting good but not Oscar caliber. The main thing that makes this movie are the fx, atmosphere, and set decoration.  Other than that this movie doesn't really have that much to offer.  Why didn't LA Confidential win best picture?  Also, doesn't James Horner's score sound recycled from Braveheart?  This movie is not as great as 15 year old girls make it out to be.</div>",Negative
61,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So much money spent for nothing. There's nothing special about that piece of crap. Nothing innovative, nothing really interesting. Plain, old, stupid-as-hell, trivial, boring love story. A well-tested money-collecting formula, product in a shiny package. Nothing else. Shame on James Cameron for bringing such a mess into the world.<br/><br/>What did you people see here that is worth 600 mln. dolars? 0/10 ...and remember people the phrase ""I shop therefore I am."" That's all this movie is about.</div>",Negative
62,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like really, really bad acting, then this enormously boring film is just the film for you! The plot is tedious and obvious. The film technique makes it difficult to tell what the special effects are - this is achieved by making everything look as if it is a badly executed special effect. You could cut two and a half hours from this film and, though it still wouldn't be any good, it would be a lot less bad.</div>",Negative
63,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this is an extremely trite, and boring movie. the acting was much too melodramatic, and although it had astounding special effects, i can not believe that they marketed it so much to the point where there was no escaping from it. the terrible marketing, made a bad movie worse, and i have only seen it once, jan 11, 2000 it was my first --and last-- time watching a movie where i sit through 3 hours of bad acting and then watch the boat sink. terrible and highly over-rated.</div>",Negative
64,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Waited as long as possible before watching this thing to let the public fanfare fade away, then one night, fell exhausted on ye olde couch with naught else to view... &amp; phew...it was far worse even than expected. Where to start? Acting? Where? Corny? Hey, Iowa aint got this much in a year. Shallow? A nickel couldn't have sunk in this thing. One word summation? EMBARRASSING. Ironic that Heavens Gate was same kind of film but beautifully made &amp; was an all-time disaster, whereas this pig was a big hit. Ah well, god bless the new economy &amp; remember PT Barnum.</div>",Negative
65,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film had good effects for a movie created in 1997. This is the only reason why it is worth watching. Once again, Hollywood does its best at taking a terrible tragedy and turning it around to be a love story. You either liked this movie for its effects and love story or you hated because of its depiction. Fist Titanic, then pearl harbor. Next, it will be on 9/11. I would like to see how America responds to a 9/11 love story. Trust me, they will do it within a few years. If you are deep into the events of titanic, it would probably be a good movie to watch. other than that, keep walking down the movie shelves.<br/><br/>later.</div>",Negative

68,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, I have seen this film, and it was a plastic-pathetic semi-lovestory. The only things worth seeing are the computer animations, but I've seen better i more low-budget movies. The three hours the film lasts seem to go on forever and ever. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go and see it, you'll just loose three hours of your life you could spend picking your teeth or anything that's more interesting.</div>",Negative
69,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I checked and I was right. This film did not win any American or British Academy Awards for ACTING! (the main purpose for a film right?) It didn't win any Golden Globes for acting either. The reason is simple. This film was terrible. The writing was bad and the the performers were worse. For all the awards this trash did win, nobody with any clout gave the actors anything. Leo didn't even get a nomination! The ship sank, and people died because a big company traded lives for profit. This story is nothing new and it has been told many times before in much better films of the same name.<br/><br/>This is 3 plus hours of my life I will never get back.</div>",Negative
70,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this movie is awful. its only good because leo dies and the special effects are decent but just because it did really well at the box office because 100 teenage girls saw it 10,000 times, so i have to say it was horrible. the story was awful and i just wanted to see the effects, they didnt need to waste the first video on their ""love"" over the course of a month... what garbage</div>",Negative
71,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yeah, you heard me. The worst Star Trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage. It is a disaster flick. Nothing more. Acting is horrible, with exception of Billy Zane who is able to do a decent job. The special effects are the only thing going for this film. I normally enjoy movies from James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator) but I found this to be horrible. And by the way, DiCaprio can't act and that's why he didn't get an Oscar for this slop. Avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value.</div>",Negative
72,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am sorry, but I believe that this film was way over rated. It was too long , and really put myself to sleep. To really put it simple- the boat sank, get over it. :)</div>",Negative
73,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought this movie extremely disappointing. The characters were not very motivating, and the acting was horrible.  I was not convinced of their roles at all.  The story line was also very poor and unrealistic.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, instead I suggest the older version made in 1953. Although it isn't recent, the story is very moving and the ending quite touching.</div>",Negative
74,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don´t know what idea of great movies does the Academy have. Movies like this one are about the same soap opera story that we have always seen in TV for years, with the only difference of good special effects. Nothing else. The Oscar shouldn´t be given to movies like this, but to innovative way to tell stories. And Titanic, for sure, is not one of those.</div>",Negative
75,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bad script, with a plot patched together from the earlier Titanic films. Bad performances.  Special effects unimpressive.  Sets no better than the ones in the far superior ""A Night to Remember"".  A theme song capable of stripping the enamel off your teeth.  This movie sucks.  One can only conclude that anyone who really loves films will hate it.</div>",Negative
76,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only thing I got from this movie was a frightful headache...They could've made it one tape and it would've been good but they had to drag the stupid story(Which wasn't much of one)out! Watch the first tape..but forget the last one!It's really not worth the headache You'll more than likely get! The stupid flashing lights really get to you after the first time you see them..But after the second You want to scream... And then they have to drag the sinking ship out for one whole tape..really a dumb movie and I don't know why everyone raved about it unless they liked staring at Kate's boobs...Thats the only thing I can figure...And the old women was really stupid... Leo's acting really stunk...And it seems to me they couldn't make up their mind on the millionares role in the whole dumb movie....If he so cared about himself he would've forgot about the slut and left... Really a stupid movie...One word describes it well...DUMB!!!</div>",Negative
77,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As much as I wish I could hide the fact that I saw this...thing...that passed for a movie, I just can't.  Titanic proved that James Cameron should never try a movie with depth or plot, or a good script, because this effort failed miserably.  It will be a cold day in hell before I EVER admit this movie deserved any of the Academy Awards it got, especially considering it's competition.  L.A. Confidential-one of the best movies ever.  Good Will Hunting-an excellent movie.  As Good As It Gets-very funny and well written. Titanic-a boat.  The awards it got are the reasons that I no longer respect the Academy of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences.  Anyone who thinks that the lead actors in this movie were good, well, all I can say is, especially if you're a guy, I feel sorry for you.  An un-original story, poor poorly acted, and far beyond any reasonable budget, the success of this movie really is beyond me.  I don't think it would hurt Mr. James 'I'm King Of the World' Cameron to refund my matinee ticket price.</div>",Negative
78,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">11 Oscars for Titanic was a misjudgment. Ben Hur is the only Movie for 11 Oscars.</div>",Negative
79,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">True that Titanic has won many many awards, even tying for most awards ever given to a film.  However, there are many many downfalls that made me comment.<br/><br/>Firstly, I would love to just say ""sucks"" and leave it at that but that would be rude.   A predictable plot and acting is in question.  I still have not seen the film but I will never watch it because of this.  The astronomical budget did not meet the end result.  Comparing this to Ben Hur which has won the most awards from the academy would make this film look like ""showgirls"" to star wars.<br/><br/>I do believe the film did deserve some credit for special fx but the budget of several hundred million dollars could have fed Millions of starving children in Ethiopia for several months..</div>",Negative
80,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">..... for a blind man who can't see the different between good movie and the bad one. actually, i admit that titanic is a very good movie. but the good part from this movie just the technics, e.g. visual effect, sound effect, editing, art direction, etc. i think the most important part from a movie is story and the performance of all cast. and titanic had sucessfully failed on that part. what a mess movie. it has an excellent technic, but weak in the story. it's like a human being without soul. it had prooven by the result of 1997 academy award that refuse to give the award for best original screenplay, best actress, and the supporting one, best actor (especially this one. leo is playing very, very bad.). i think i'll just stand next to the other film criticisian who believe that the 1997 best movie is not titanic. say congratulation to.... : ""L. A. CONFIDENTIAL""</div>",Negative
81,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watching this movie disturbed me for a number of reasons. I wasn't going in expecting Terminator 3, but I was expecting an intelligent epic romance. Instead It seemed like I was sitting in a seat that was reserved for a 14 year old girl, and I felt very out of my element...and sleepy...very sleepy.<br/><br/>Secondly I was disturbed by the casting, Dicaprio &amp; Winslet seemed a very unlikely and awkward match. Dicaprio seemed much younger and much......smaller than grown-up sized Winslet. The romance was weak, cheezy, over dramatic, and poorly justified.<br/><br/>But like I mentioned, there is a special effects pay off at the end. For the guys.</div>",Negative
82,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Pardon my bluntness, but this movie sucks.  It's nothing more than a cheesy love story that we've all seen a hundred times.  Nice girl, bad boy, evil fiancee, blah-blah-blah. Oh yeah, the ship sinks at the end. What this movie should have focused on, the tragedy of what happened that night, is missed.  We get a three hour love story and a one hour SFX overload.  Yeah, greatest movie of all time alright.</div>",Negative
83,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the worst movies ever made yet one of the largst budget ones. A cheesy love story, no effects worth mentioning except for one where the boat sinks. There is one surprise in the movie - the boat sinks. Could anyone have guessed it? Awful soundtrack. There is absolutely no need to see it.</div>",Negative
84,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Horribly flat characters, laughably pathetic dialogue.  Only the impressive big budget scenery saved this from being a total shipwreck of a movie.</div>",Negative
85,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are movies that you don't care for the first time you see them, but when you think back it grows on you. So you see it again, and realize that it is, in fact, a great film. Then there is this overrated piece of drek. Now, I will admit it was beautifully filmed. But it was so overblown, so drawn out, that the more I think of it the more I hated it. It was unrealistic to the point of just being impossible for me to enjoy. The characters- with the exception of Jack, Molly Brown, and Thomas Andrews- were impossible for me to like, and therefore, care about. I know that Rose was supposed to be the heroine, but she was just a spoiled little rich girl. It's a shame this tripe won an Oscar for best picture.</div>",Negative
86,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Oh, I do have to bow my head to ""Titanic"".<br/><br/>But not to Cameron for creating a visual feast. Not to the actors for such inspiring, and creative characterisation (sic), but instead, I bow my head to mourn for the loss of respect for the millions of people who returned to see this twaddle more than once.<br/><br/>A nauseatingly dreadful, utterly manipulative, saccharine dusted gob of tedious pap.<br/><br/>Doubtless it will be hailed as the greatest film ever by those who think ""Aliens"" is better than ""Alien"", and who think that film history started with ""Jaws"".</div>",Negative
87,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everything about this movie it's garbage . Inane ,dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie .<br/><br/>I don't care anything about all the hype that this movie receives ,or that it won the Academy Award of best movie (so what ? Many bad movies receive a lot of praise and prizes for the success that those movies have in the box office rather than in the real artistic value ) The acting it's bad and all the story it's a bad soap opera that uses history as a excuse to tell the story of all the days . Deep inside ,it's just a glorified chick -flick . I'm not amazed that it was chosen to be part of the list ""100 years ,100 stinkers "" . ""Titanic it's the most over rated garbage ever made .Zero stars .</div>",Negative
88,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As I first saw Titanic, I was indeed pleased with the result of the film. Nevertheless, I always thought about it as a typical love story as we have seen it a hundred times with the difference of the ...Titanic.<br/><br/>Special Effects were good, the sinking was very well done. Even the more than three hours didn't bother me a lot. A few months later, I watched it again, this time on video. Since I'm not a di Caprio fan, I concentrated on the plot of on him. It was bad. This second time the movie bored the hell out of me. It is one of those movies you can get a complete awersion to. The plot is bad, dialogues are even worse and visual efects didn't look all too impresive either, just compare it with other, cheaper, movies.<br/><br/>All in all after seeing the movie the first time I would have given it a rating of 9, now it gets a 1 (only because I can't rate below zero).</div>",Negative
89,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Now don't get me wrong I thought the special fx were great! But the acting was cheesy and laughable. I laughed in this movie so much from the horrible acting and sappy, cheesy dialouge. The lenghth of the movie was crazy! It dragged on and on! I actually fell asleep! The music wasn't so great either. That crappy Celine Dion song adds to the cheesinest. This movie also won waaaaaaaaaay to many awards then it deserved! It deserved all the technical and special fx awards, but the other ones............ no. Pretty good cast, Kate Winslet's a babe. :) I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have made fun of this movie! it would have been a great episode!</div>",Negative
90,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is so historically inaccurate that it should be considered a satire. It's extremely disappointing and the acting is subpar. Hopefully they'll do a remake of an actual story that occurred on the Titanic.</div>",Negative
91,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie twice and I truly loved it.  However the over-hype made me dislike it.  The money does not even come close to indicating quality.  I never cried.  It was WAY too predicable.  The fx was what made me go again.  The fact is the movie isn't that powerful.  James Horner's score sound like rejects from Bravheart which by the way is a much better movie at capturing romance and action.  You want quality, watch a much better actor in Mel Gibson than fly-by-night DiCaprio.</div>",Negative
92,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't even know where to begin, there are so many flaws mistakes and general errors. Hey I know how about starting by saying that the script is absolutely dreadful. Nothing happens for three whole hours. After an hour you just sit there and wait for the ship to sink already. I couldn't help cheering when the ship finally sunk. OK I admit there are a few good scenes in the film. For an example at the end of the film someone falls down and hits one of the propellers and makes a kind of dull ""bong"" sound when he does it and then starts spinning rapidly in the air. Most of the effects are alright but the general acting as well as the weak and boring story makes this the worst big budget film ever made perhaps aside from the Harry Potter series. All in all 1 out of 6</div>",Negative
93,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was impressive the first time I saw it. Now, the luster is gone from this, ahem, ""best movie of all time."" This movie is just another computer generated image with people, who aren't even very good actors, stuck in to give it life. It's no different than Cameron's ""T2"". It also loses much of its effect when it's not in the theater. It is now only a more than three hour (yawn) movie that could have been squeezed in under two and a half.</div>",Negative
94,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This by far is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. The movie was mostly crude, and had very few laughs which disappointed me because I was told this movie was very funny. I guess you can't always go by what other people tell you. The acting was horrible. My husband said to me, ( Who told you that this movie was funny? Were they even watching the same movie that we just saw?)I just can't figure this out. Why anyone would recommend this movie is beyond me. I would not recommend this movie, and I will tell people straight up to not waist their time. I'm a Leonardo Dicaprio fan, but this movie is a poopy tiny baby diaper.</div>",Negative
95,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie, which is mediocre at best, has been called a ""modern classic"" by many. If there wasn't such a media following to this so-so movie, I might've actually enjoyed it. But, however, my expectations were high and the movie simply did not deliver. Not worth wasting 3 1/2 hours of your life on.</div>",Negative
96,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very disappointed with this one. The worst ever casting simply adds more stupidity to the already thoughtless plot. I would expect more from the movie that cost more than $200,000,000. The special effects are very expensive but primitive and not really necessary for the movie.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, the movie is not SO bad. It is just not worth (art-wise) the money spent on it. The movie's qualities are of a middle level. There are hundreds of movies like this one. The only thing that is special here is the budget.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I watched the movie once (well almost once, it is way too oversized, I could not make it through the whole movie) and this is enough for me!</div>",Negative
97,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't begin to express how bored I was with this movie. It's not that it was a poorly made movie. I understand the movies appeal to the romantics at heart, but that still does not validate it as the best movie of all time. It was boring, far too long, and completely uninteresting. I've always thought the movie could have stood on it's own as a much more fascinating film if the first half had never been made. Cameron did a tremendous job of showing the horror and hopelessness the members of the ship felt while the ship was sinking. But it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie, it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time.  This movie was thoroughly uninteresting, and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel. 1/10</div>",Negative
98,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was boring and a complete waste of time. Instead of spending more time about the ship, they wasted the movie with some stupid, dumb, love story. This movie was pointless, dull, and a waste of 3 hours and 14 minutes of my life. This is for everyone who hasen't seen yet- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Overall 1/10</div>",Negative
99,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">please...it is a three hour sinking boat...yeah we feel bad for the people who lost their lives..that is why we're making millions of dollars to exploit their death...great job Cameron...why not do a 9-11 film now? or the 1906 earthquake? The funny thing is that I have to come up with ten lines about how a boat sank....wasn't that the dilemma that James Cameron had? Trying to fill 180 minutes for a boat that sank just as fast and make it a little more interesting than the horror that it was? How can we sucker punch people to go to a movie that is simply tragic so that we can remind them to avoid pleasure cruise boats from the early 1900s especially around icebergs...trudging slowly around an obvious and uncreative storyline....blah blah blah..I wasted 6 hours of my life with Titanic and Pearl Harbor...monumental days in American History destroyed in 6 slow torturing hours...why not rip my fingernails out???</div>",Negative
100,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I simply hate this movie. Like Pearl Harbor it takes a life/world changing historical event and waxes it with stupid unnecessary pukey love stories.</div>",Negative
101,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not only was the plot dodgy at best, but the actors was wooden, the effects shoody to say they cost millions, and the background looked like it was painted on. How on earth would Kate Winslet's character ever have fallen for that excuse for an actor DiCaprio</div>",Negative
102,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the ""masterpiece"" that all these ""Titanic"" fanboys like to make it out as. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting ""skills"" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is the most overrated movie to date. Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.</div>",Negative
103,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of only 2 movies I've ever walked out of! Have attempted to watch on 3 separate occassions, and can only find 3 redeeming qualities: 1 - Kathy Bates' portrayal of 'Molly' Brown, 2 - Incredible soundtrack, and 3 - quite good cinematography. In every other respect this film is an absolute dog.</div>",Negative

105,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A poor flick all around. The only redeeming value comes from the actual sinking of the Titanic, which unfortunately doesn't happen in the first ten minutes. We do get to watch a pathetic love story between Jack &amp; Rose. Actually more like a molestation by Rose since Jack appears to be approximately twelve years old. Very creepy. Oh yeah, horribly casted! I forgot. I can't believe I let my wife talk me into seeing this one when it came out. Let this be a lesson to you all. Cameron is definitely a second rate director and a questionable human being to boot.(Just ask Linda Hamilton) To sum it up, run far and fast from this film. It will only disappoint you. I give it 1 out of ten. Awful is about right.</div>",Negative
106,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Terrible.  Bad actors besides Kathy bates.  Way too overrated.  The worst plot.  Just Urgh.  No stars.  0 out of 10.  Kathy Bates saved the movie.  I can't believe it won al those Oscars. No way!  It won as much as Ben Hur and Ben Hur was way better.</div>",Negative
107,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting was rather mediocre, the love story was no different than any other love story, and the movie has one hour too long.  However, the sets were wonderful, the costumes exceptional, and the special effects unforgettable.  The movie was good, but nonetheless overrated.</div>",Negative
108,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will admit it, I got sucked up into the Titanic hype, and went to see the Movie with my girlfriend. We were both disappointed. Yes, the visual effects are good, but the true story behind Titanic is the astonishment and shock of the worlds most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage. The fact that it was labeled unsinkable, yet sank! All the unfortunate victims of its doomed first and final voyage. Not about two kids who boink in the back seat of some jalopy! It needed to show more realism, the truth, and have a much better, stronger story. The movie was simply filled with too much cheesy acting, and not enough facts. I'm not saying this cause I'm a guy, I'm saying this because it is what was evidently clear in my eyes when i saw this film, and is congenial with the eyes of many others.</div>",Negative
109,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">after hearing all the praise Titanic got from loads of people i knew i was expecting a half decent film, instead i got bad acting, unbelievable characters and a story which made no sense (i will come back to this). I couldn't belive how fake kate and leo were, they were rubbish. I spent half the film laughing at the awful script ""i'm on top of the world"" was perhaps the funniest line. The story itself was the strangest thing about the film, we are apparently being told the film through rose's eyes, yep, but half the time we are seeing things that rose didn't see herself.?. My skin crawls every time some teenager states this as their all time favourite film.</div>",Negative
110,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How on Earth did James Cameron sign on to make this! Fortunately at least 1/3 of the film is spent on a not-so-bad sinking scene...but still that's no excuse for a twisted overrated love affair that desperately wants to be Gone With The Wind or Spartacus but falls victim to its plain stupidity. No one talks about this movie nowadays or even whimpers at the soundtrack anymore which REALLY ticks me off because these are the same people who saw this film 178 times. Hollywood should stick with budget-busting action films like Die Hard that have stayed popular for nearly two decades.</div>",Negative
111,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm all for sappiness...however Titanic takes it too far, and raises a big problem.<br/><br/>The casting absolutely stunk, exception being Gloria Stuart.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable. The emotion just didn't set well.<br/><br/>The Titanic is dead, leave it dead.</div>",Negative
112,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">oh my god this movie is awful i hate this movie one of the worst movies what the world has ever produced and of course the worst soundtrack ever ""my heart will go on"" Celine Dion big crap. it must be a epic but it's a piece of crap.Titanic,the ship of dreams i say titanic the ship of crap.i don't i hate people who dead in 1912.but titanic is crap.it's silly and overrated.i don't understand why this crap won 11 Oscars why?it's so boring movie.i didn't even liked the acting it was too hammy.James Cameron is not bad director,but this is black piece to his movies.so i don't recommend it to anyone.watch something else.maybe a lot of people love this movie but i hate this movie. 1.5/10</div>",Negative
113,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just 3 hours of waiting for the ship to crush all the movie is just a romantic crap no one should watch this movie even not in the cost of your life cause this movie is longer Satan create this movie with a wish to take us all off like he did with his last terror ""Avatar"", from the other side pies would never hurt no one. what if banana can fly, Why I sit in the dark wait for the movie to end? but it never stops ""I love you"" he say but she never listen. bang bang he run try to catch them! crap so obvious whats going on! MAKE IT STOP! why the boat so big? is ice is so strong? is man land on freezing water to die for other people on the new land? this journey could be much more cool with giant rabbits! P.S</div>",Negative
114,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must've been drunk. The acting is wooden, the character development almost non-existent and the music irritating(I HATE Celine Dion). The FX are great, but who cares?. Of the cast, Leo has one good moment at the end, but it drags on. Kate looks terrible in her costumes, but it's nice to see she's not a twig. Pity she can't act. Billy Zane has seldom shown restraint, and this film is no exception. Oscar winner Kathy Bates, however is solid as an iceberg...er...rock as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, but she can't save it. Jim Cameron has been responsible for many screen classics, but this isn't one of 'em. The dialogue is extremely funny. To give you an indication of how much I luuurrvved this film, the Federal election was on at the same time, and I decided to watch a bit of that!Would I have enjoyed it more on the big screen?Dialogue and characterisation is no different at the cinemas. The worst academy award nominated film of the year, but that's not saying much.</div>",Negative
115,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Why'd I watch this movie? I coulda been watching something else! Something I would've enjoyed! Leo made me wanna dig my eyes out, the injustice of Kate's Academy Award nomination made me want to scream, (I was so happy when Helen won over Kate) and the fact that they would cheapen such a tragedy with this love line, well, I'll just leave it at that. Highly overrated for cheap acting (minus Kathy Bates) and one weasle-looking rat-boy wuss in the lead. What was I thinking?</div>",Negative
116,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It looks very good and the technical aspects are to be admired, but when you get to the nuts and bolts (script and acting) it just sucks.<br/><br/>Im never going to get the 3 hours of my life back that I wasted watching this 'movie'<br/><br/>Yuck.</div>",Negative
117,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie made way too much money!  Cameron shouldn't direct a love story! There was way too much hype behind this movie, the music got old VERY VERY QUICKLY mostly due to the radio stations playing it several times within each day, Decaprio, isn't a very good actor, and he kinda looks like one of the Hanson brothers, meaning VERY feminine!  This movie was also way too long for a love story!  If you want to see a good love story see What Dreams May Come!  Due to this film, I now dislike the name Cameron, and that's pretty bad coming from someone who loved Abyss, Terminator2, and Aliens, to put it simply I hated this film!</div>",Negative
118,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a load of hype about nothing very much. The people who made this movie were so engrossed in special effects and massive budgets that they neglected to notice the cliched story line and consequently missed the opportunity to highlight the real tragedy of the event - that a few minor differences in circumstance would have altered the result of that fateful night entirely. What a waste!</div>",Negative
119,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It reminds me of Star Wars in the sense that it was a good film, even maybe considered a great film. Yet no way should this film have gotten the media hype, and numerous awards which it did. I like Star Wars a lot, just like this, but one thing I hope to never see is a Kate Winslet/ L. Dicaprio (don't get me started about his acting skills, if any even exist) model figurines in an antique shop for 200$. *** or maybe ***1/2 stars for this flick, but don't bother to see it more than once- James Cameron is rich enough as is.</div>",Negative
120,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If the director would take the whole lovey-dovey rich-but-unhappy-girl-meets-poor-but-noble-boy story line out of the movie, ""Titanic"" could be actually pretty decent and mildly entertaining. There were some touching and/or ironic moments. However, the amount of cheese made it obnoxious and annoying waste of time.</div>",Negative
121,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'll be brief: It ain't that good. The characters are lame, the script is awful, the situations are not entirely correct, the F/X ain't that cool... I found Godzilla more amusing... at least you knew it was bad since the beginning. SO, if you get a chance to see ""A night to remember"", go and do so. Don't waste your time with Leo DiCucu.</div>",Negative
122,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, this movie had a great success... because it had all that you can require from a movie : a love story, historical background, suspense, a nice ""jeune premier"", social differences, special effects... everything to be sold ! The best example of a commercial movie (or how to kill the only true cinema, ""le 7eme art"")</div>",Negative
123,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron should be hauled out and shot for even thinking that this screenplay was remotely intelligent. And to think, this is the same James Cameron who made Terminator. Mr. Cameron stick to making shallow action films and let drama be done by the people with some actual artistic integrity like P.T. Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Spike Lee, and Todd Field.</div>",Negative
124,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this movie with my father on video. When Jack started commenting on the dolphins, he left, saying: ""If this is the quality of dialogue, I'm going."" That about sums it up, really. It was a good idea, and a terrible delivery. In want of severe editing, better writing, and more convincing actors, Titanic was probably the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. With a well-respected cast, (Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates, to name a few) 14 Oscar nominations, and 11 wins, I was expecting a beautiful tale of star-crossed lovers and ill-fated voyages. And it could have been that. But unnecessary scenes, uninteresting dialogue, and wooden performances hindered what could have been an amazing movie.</div>",Negative
125,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Even if you put aside the fact that this movie could never have lived up to the hype that was put out for this movie, it still was a horrible movie. the movie was complete fiction, except for the boat.  It really sank, but none of the plot was true.  The movie was a disgrace.  It used a historic tragedy to get people to watch their subpar movie.  The movie was completely predictable, and the basic concept has been done over and over and over again.  I am ashamed that audiences flocked to a movie that just wasn't very good.  It is a disgrace to Hollywood that a movie that grossed the most money ever ($600 mil) isn't even in the IMDB top 250 movies of all time. it just shows you how hollywood is only concerned with profits and not with making quality movies.</div>",Negative
126,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I hated this film it didn't have one single exciting part. The thing that made this movie so lame is that weather you are 100 or 1 you knew exactly what was going to happen and those are the boring kind of movies.</div>",Negative
127,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I finally, finally broke down to watch this (I know, I know, it took some time to do it) and now I know why it took me so long. My Lord, this sorry excuse for a movie is just plain awful. I haven't experience this much movie-viewing pain since trying to sit through Brokeback Mountain, another highly overrated, badly acted, sorry excuse of time and effort. Sappy dialog, boring, over-the-top characters, dull and predictable storyline, and so on and so on. The costume designs, set decorations, cinematography, and special effects were definitely worthy of notice, but nothing else. And to realize that this worthless piece of trash won the Best Picture Oscar over L.A. Confidential, a brainy, stylish, police drama, is unbelievably pathetic. But then again, I have noticed that most of the viewing public, including critics and Hollywood, don't like to think too much. In that case, this movie's for you!</div>",Negative

131,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Seriously, this could not have made that much money, it is one of the worst movies I have seen, not the worst though. It is VERY over rated though. There isn't much to this movie, and story line is sooooo corny. Rose DeWitt Bukater, Kate Winslet's character is to me, a floozy! The only good part was when they were all dying, that was funny. Otherwise, this isn't a romantic movie, Romeo and Juliet, even though they both die is romantic, but this is not. It is an exploitation of the titanic disaster, and that is it.

I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible.

Man, how can you stand to hear that BS all the time ?? Leo is dying, so what and he's doing it at least 30 minutes. And three hours long film, please !

Paper thin plots, characterizations, and with an excessive running time that makes you wish only that the iceberg had been bigger. The acting is awful and completely under uses the talents of both DiCaprio and Winslett. DiCaprio is capable of acting, look at ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", and Winslett has had some charing roles as well, but neither of them can give much in this straight jacket of a script. Directing a large boat into a chunk of floating ice is hardly a talent worth accolades, Cameron has done better. Once upon a time, he made movies that were marginally imaginative, Titanic certainly puts an end to that. It's a pity because you've already probably seen and suffered through this one, but if not, skip it. Chasey Lane can give more feeling and ""Night of the Living Dead"" more story.</div>",Negative

That year, people like Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were nominated and for good reason, they know how to act.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast in Titanic was brilliant.  They portrayed people from early this century.  In contrast, DiCaprio came acted like some ""aw shucks"" kid from 1997.  He didn't blend at all making his performance the weakest part of this film.  Add that to a story that's been told a million times over, and Titanic becomes a weak movie overall.</div>",Negative
172,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving.  The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.  Such a shame - given the dreadful, tragic setting (which, let's face it, really did happen), it could have been a good film.......</div>",Negative
173,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best film ever, most certainly not. Best film of 1997, again not in with a chance. I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.</div>",Negative

The story line is borrowed from ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""; and, the effects are only okay.

200,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film insults the intelligence of the viewer.

'Saved By The Bell' had more subtle moral storytelling than this so- called film. If special effects, no realistic characterisation (or accents), and a poor script are your ideas of fun then watch it. Otherwise don't touch it with a barge pole.</div>",Negative
201,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">i hated this movie.  i will be honest.  i wanted to like it because james camaron is sooo cool. (true lies is one of my favorite movies!)  i gave this movie a three.  the script was horrible.  i was dying of laughter right there in the theater in front of all the teary eyed girls, i mean the girl next to me was actually crying (her-""oh not leo!"" me-""excuse me, i am trying to nap here!"")  it took like a whole day the watch the borefest. 5 hours of crap before the iceberg hit.  then when the boat crunched and cracked that was pretty good.  the best part of the movie takes about a nanosecond.  that is when some guy falls and like hits his head on a boat propeller and starts twirling around.  i was rolling with laughter.  other than that....zzzzz.  and the crap with that old chick was played out!  who cares about these uninteresting people?  i wanted them to crash into the iceberg and then have polar bears leap out onto the deck and start mauling people.  then arnold would show up (because this is james camaron) and like take no prisoners or something.  i don't know...anything to end my suffering.</div>",Negative
202,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ultimate chick flick that is disguised by giving some nudity. The acting is so so. Dicaprio tried to save the movie for us guys but the plot was too weak for us dudes. Love stories can only do so much for the male department. However, even the background characters look good. The costumes were well done to look like 1912. Still the plot wasn't there. The actual sinking surprised me to death. Didn't see that one coming. Basically Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic except that was a good story. Dicaprio showed a few flashes of brilliance but that wasn't enough to save the three hours of nothing. The only thing that is worse than this film is how sadly overrated it was. A lot of good movies came out in the nineties and some of them deserve a second look. This one however doesn't. It's replay value is extremely poor and no guy I know would want to watch the whole thing more than once. A real boring film.</div>",Negative
203,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yuck.  Normally, I can lose myself in a movie, at least the first time...but I found myself picking apart this overlong bucket of drivel before I got halfway through.  Only a very good performance by Winslett, as well as a surprisingly decent DiCaprio performance, is keeping me from rating this movie 3/10....because all of the other ""acting"" in this waste of celluloid is horrific.  The special effects are okay, the soundtrack is good (well, at least until Celine Dion opens her mouth)....but this picture had about as much business as ""Ghost"" in getting nominated for (much less winning) a Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>5/10</div>",Negative
204,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite having excellent special effects there was something definitely wrong with Titanic. Its script was mediocre at best though some good acting did break through. However, in my opinion it had one major fault -IT WAS ANTI-BRITISH.Nowadays people don't seem to care about Hollywood insults to their country but signs of this prejudice appear in the film. For instance all of the British are portrayed as upper-class twits, cowards, etc who bumbled into this in the first place. The Irish appear as being oppressed and the Americans and Irish are all the heroes. It was also a fact that First Officer Murdoch didn't act in that way (and the makers had to apologise to the town and famly where he lived) So when is Hollywood going to end these films which attack the British evidently or subtley?</div>",Negative
205,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I put 4 only because it is one of the blockbusters and it has some effects, also some not so bad acting. First thing I hate about this movie it is too long. Second thing is its not romantic, it is over any limits and really not touching at all. Another thing is the music I hate, awful really, I believe Canadians have many better things... We watched it with a friend and the only moment we liked was really when Leonardo dived never to appear again. If you watch only this movie you will hate him, but I give him the credit for other movies. As one here said I love to hate it, yes and most of the people I know hate it. This is a really awful production , an example of what you can make with lots of money and no feelings and brains at all.</div>",Negative
206,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Reading through the comments I see alot of people saying stuff like ""I wanted to see a ship sink, so shallow characters did not matter."" Come on people, sitting through 2 hours of poor dialog just to see 10 minutes of nice special effects is no excuse for giving this movie anything more then a rating of 2 or 3 (4 if you are generous). A movie should be judged on the sum of all of its components. While the special effects in this movie would warrant an 8 or 9, the characters sucked, the plot was quite lame, and the movie was slow up until the boat sank. I regret wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie, and wish that I could have walked in on the last 10 minutes, rather then sat through it. The things men do for our girlfriends...</div>",Negative
207,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a film which relies entirely on the fact that it is about something very sad that really happened.  If the Titanic didn't really sink, everyone would see how poor an attempt at a film this is.  The script is laughable. It is obvious that much more time went into the authenticity of the cutlery and so on than the characters.  James Cameron did not deserve an award for this.</div>",Negative
208,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie really sucks... ! It is very predictable and the story is not that great. Kate Winslet is a great actress and she is also the only good thing in this movie. Leonardo makes a really bad role even worse. The music is okay and the scenery is... okay. If you see this movie once- it's enough!</div>",Negative
209,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic would have made for a perfectly acceptable hour-and-a-half film. The set design and costuming - all the period details, really - were fantastic, and the plot, albeit formulaic, at least held to Hollywood's general standard of mediocrity, and no worse than that. But where is it written that the length of a movie has to be relatively commeasurate to the vessel on which it is set? What this movie needed was a good editing - preferably by an editor armed with a chainsaw. Instead of settling for a passable 5-star, yea, even enjoyable 6-star historical romance, they shot for the moon - and produced an exercise in tedium and self-indulgence. I find it most noteworthy for the fact that it is the only movie in film history that ever managed to make me root for an iceberg. An unusual sensation, and no mean feat.</div>",Negative
210,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a travesty of justice. Any movie that this one was up against in '97 was better. The real crime was L.A. Confidential not winning. This movie sucks. If anything it showed that Mr. Cameron could organize lots of people. Nothing more than that. Predictable. Bad acting. Boring story line. Wasted dollars. Even Good Will Hunting was better than this piece of trite filth. ""The Full Monty"" was better than ""Titanic."" I would challenge anyone to dispute this fact, I can easily dispel any non beleivers. I haven't watched the Oscars since this terrible evil happened. I mean if you want to watch a good ocean going movie try ""Master and Comander.""</div>",Negative
211,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">According to me, this film is a total disaster. Not only because of the naive and cheesy dialogs but also for bad acting and for wasting people's money and thought into this unrealistic middleclassy ""romantic"" drama. 11 Oscars and tons of other nominations for what? What were these people thinking about? If this film is so great, how come 82000 IMDb users think it is below average?<br/><br/>Is it because ""20th Century Fox"" knew that all the time spent on lowering the viewers standards and ideals, finally would pay off? I do not know. But something that I do know is that almost everyone that likes this film are totally uneducated in life and the art of projecting it in on a filmscreen.</div>",Negative
212,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definetly not one of the best movies ever. Two hours and nothing happens</div>",Negative
213,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a really difficult movie and not for your average movie goer. I'm surprised it's had the success it's had at the box office because this movie is a thinker. I thought this was suppose to re-imagine what 3D in the movies would be like, with new worlds with animals flying and blue people connected to everything. I missed all of that. All this is is about the boat Titanic and I didn't finish it but it seems like it was just an excuse to look at Leo and Kate kiss each other. Nice soundtrack through.</div>",Negative
214,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Garbage film. Leo's career will never be the same. Absolute tripe.</div>",Negative
215,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Like I said not a bad movie but I just couldn't wait for the ship to sink</div>",Negative
216,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you cut out the first two hours you might have a decent movie here, but most of the movie is wasted on the stupid love story and not on the true facts of what actually did happen on that night. The special effects of the ship were excellent, too bad it was wasted on a bad story.</div>",Negative
217,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have only one thing to comment: Titanic got down in 1912, russians reached it in 1992 or 1993 (the new russian flag on the craft was adopted in 1992). So, what should be the age of Rose DeWitt Bukater? 107 as minimum!!!<br/><br/>It is dangerous to go so deep at this age, mom!</div>",Negative
218,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What disturbs me the most about ""Titanic"", that in the minds of millions of people, the tragedy of the eponymous ocean liner will be forever replaced with a fictional romantic story of a British girl and a American boy. Did the film make you actually care about 1500 passengers who died in the crash? Very unlikely. We're supposed to mourn the girl's lost lover instead. 1958's ""A Night to Remember"" offered both the more historically accurate account of the event and the human drama behind it. Along with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Titanic"" is a sad example of how the actual history is being replaced by Hollywood's fictionalized versions of it. Dream factory, indeed.</div>",Negative
219,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Lack-luster script and bad performances sink the Titanic in this  visually beautiful but stupid epic. Tank Girl is still the best movie of all time.</div>",Negative
220,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a decent movie.  But it was all hype.  The two most hyped parts of this film, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the two worst actors in the movies.  Billy Zane and Bill Paxton were surperb, but they didn't get nearly enough screen time.  Anyway, if you see this movie, expect to both hate and love the bad guy, which is what a makes a good movie great.  The rest of the acting (excluding Victor Garber and Bernard Hill) was weak. Overall, it deserves a 3.  Sorry, girls.</div>",Negative
221,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Annoying, cloying script. I don't think I could ever stomach seeing this movie again. The characters and script seem to have been based on a comic book. The cinematography is pretty good, though. Watch it with the sound off.</div>",Negative
222,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had a lot of eye catching effects.  It could be quite fascinating...for a minute.  Cameron would knock you out with some stunning image, and then throw cold water on the proceedings with his goofy, tired, ordinary, teen-aged love story.  A pathetic waste.  I may have been too generous with my three star rating.</div>",Negative
223,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I try to like the movie, I really tried, I watched it as least 3 times. I just can't find myself liking it. I just don't find it a as a great movie that can win 11 nomination. I mean I like the Gone with wind, Froset Gump and Saving Pivate Ryan...etc But Titianic? Man, it's not touchy to me as to some of you girls. I guess I'm just not compassion enough. It meanly became popular because of the media advertisement and all the positive review. I think the movie only attracts woman to see it because of love story. Guys go to see simply because Kate Winslet was totally naked in it. The digital effect? It's not like mind blowing or anything, it's only a film set that fills with water and sunk a big prop ship. Jesus, how could that be the ""Best visual effect""</div>",Negative
224,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought this movie was tremendously overrated. Considering the talent involved, it should have been a lot better. First of all, the movie went on way too long and although both great actors, DiCaprio and Winslett didn't match well together. In the kissing scenes I felt like I was watching a boy make out with his mother. I read somewhere that the Kate Winslett role was originally offered to Renee Zellweger, but that wouldn't have mattered because the entire movie was one big yawn. There were a few good scenes, but this movie should have only been an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters, not nearly three hours long. I also thought the lighting was really bad and the ship looked really fake in the water scenes. I am sure I am in the minority on this, but I would rather watch paint dry and listen to music than sit thought this entire movie again.</div>",Negative
225,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't really like this movie. I think it's fine and all, but it is very over-hyped. How it beat out 'Good Will Hunting' for best picture, one will never know. It is so very boring. I don't care for Gloria Stuart's character, although I think she plays her very well. I don't care about the old, boring people looking for the jewels, I just want to see the boat sink, just like everyone else. It is directed very badly, and how James Cameron won best director is a mystery to me, and many other people too. Kate Winslet did a lack-luster job, and that is hard for me to say, seeing as I adore her in everything else she is in. I think that it was a bad film and that it shouldn't have won any of the awards it did, because it was not good at all. Big budget doesn't necessarily mean big hit. In this case, it means big dumb movie.</div>",Negative
226,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film was over-hyped, and as a result made much less impression on me. I found the heavily revisionist element wearisome at best, disgraceful at worst. The acting is good, but the animation / graphics are poor.</div>",Negative
227,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have seen ""Titanic"" twice.  From the beginning, it has promise, but the promise fades away when the upper-class passengers are all depicted as cold-hearted, selfish villains with little or no humanity at all.  The ""villains"" are too cartoonish to be real, much less entertaining.  Especially in the cases of ""Cal"" and ""Mr. Lovejoy"", who are even psychopathic!  We know right off that the girl's fiancee is someone to root against because 1) she has to end up with Leo, so she cannot be allowed to desire this man; 2) he is arrogant enough to put half of Hollywood to shame; 3) with his lines ""God himself could not sink this ship"" and ""Picasso: he won't amount to anything; trust me, he won't"" we know that he is an idiot, and a waste of her time.  The special effects were outstanding, but I can't help thinking that if only the movie had depended more on good writing than the hearthrob factor, that it would have been a much better movie.</div>",Negative
228,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is insulting to think that this film was well-received. I guess it would be tragic if a film this well shot and expensive was turned down. Think about it, for one, Leonardo DiCaprio, as usual, delivers a crappy performance that is almost laughable, and so does Kate Winslet and the other people in the cast. Secondly, there is no great story- it is just a love story in the midst of an event that everyone knows about. Thirdly, the only reason it won Best Picture at the Oscars was because of the ending which is often mocked in commercials and the main song which is recognizable to anyone. The only reason it was a Box Office success was because it's the Titanic! It is a major event- no one was looking for a love story! Nothing goes for this movie except special effects and a nice song- PATHETIC!</div>",Negative
229,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now that the hype is over, this movie shows itself as the ho-hum affair it is.  The special effects can't make up for ordinary script and acting.  It may have been a tour de force to create it, but the overall result is a run of the mill Hollywood movie.</div>",Negative
230,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not the greatest film of all time but then again not the worse. Titanic is, at best, an average movie which contains some pretty impressive special effects. The story however is not believable and neither are the characters. It was way too long for one thing. I do applaud James Cameron for target marketing this film toward the right audience i.e. the teenage/younger crowd which is where it made its money. That of course IS the bottom line. This film probably isn't even the best one about the tragic event. Years from now people may view this movie and say ""How did this win the Academy Award for Best Picture that year?""</div>",Negative
231,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes it does entertain, and doesn't feel like 3 hours plus. However this film is pretty poor. Some of the lines like ""that Picasso will never amount to anything"", and ""i'm so lucky to be on the Titanic"" are crass beyond belief. Billy Zane is like a baddie out of a bad episode of Scooby-Doo. Why didn't the salvage crew tell the old dear to get on with it, and just tell them where the necklace was? Script over special effects please.</div>",Negative
232,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Until ""Titanic"", Kate Winslet and Leo DiCapprio had been the most gifted young actors of their generation, both capable of quite extraordinarily profound insights into the human soul, given their tender years. In James Cameron's Oscar-winning film, they constitute one of the most attractive couples in movie history. And so they became world superstars. But as I see it, they deserve their fame. It is a tragic thing to see acting greatness remain more or less unsung, or underrated. And in ""Titanic"" Kate Winslet supplies a magnetic and powerful performance. Moreover, The scenes depicting the sinking of the ship are thrilling to behold. ""Titanic"" is in short a fine film, which made megastars out of two magnificent young artists, a compromise between artistic integrity and commercial clout.</div>",Negative
233,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Rich girl falls in love with poor boy, much to the dismay of her mother and fiance.  Hasn't this been done before?  Hasn't it been done better?  Hasn't it been done with dialog that is above the 3rd grade level?  The last hour was very exciting, but the first two were dull and predictable.</div>",Negative
234,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How on earth could this movie have won an Oscar for best film? The string ensemble continuing to play as the ship was sinking was straight out of Monty Python. There was no sense of terror as the ship began to flood. Instead you sat back and admired the clever way the director filmed the ship filling up with water - how it burst through ceilings and doors and whooshed its way along the corridors. Surely we were meant to feel for the poor panic-stricken passengers?- the director obviously didn't.<br/><br/>As for the romance between Leo and Kate - they have to be one of the most mismatched couples in movie history. It might have had a big budget but this has to be one of the poorest ever movies to win an Oscar - what was the Academy thinking of?</div>",Negative
235,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film must only appeal to a person with the mentality of someone who has gone as far as the 8th grade.  If you want to see real film watch Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather.  The dialogue in this film is an insult to anyone's intelligence who has went past high school education-wise.  The most terrible line in the film?  ""Jack I'm flying!!!""  I felt like saying great keep flying off of the bow of this ship so this movie will end, you obese sow.  This movie was very painful.  By the way, this film was and is not ""awesome"" or ""way cool"" as some have stated.  The approving comments below and their lack of grammatical accuracy, just proves that people who like this film are trailer trash who do not have a good grasp on the king's English.</div>",Negative
236,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic Review: Titanic was written so poorly by James Cameron, that it felt like a comedy. I don;t want to be rude or anything, but it was just so horribly written that I couldn't anything in it seriously. Including the sinking, and I might have bin laughing. Don't take me for a nasty person, it's James Cameron's fault. One part that really annoyed me was the fact that Cameron tried to makes us cry and be dramatic by sticking a dead baby in the water. It made me say, ""What are you trying to do James?"". I mean, he was purposely trying to be dramatic and when you do that, it fails. It failed for me. It was just a dumb thing to do and I really thought it was a horrible movie. If you think the screenplay in this movie was good, then you really need a doctor.</div>",Negative
237,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Make no mistake, I think James Cameron is a great filmmaker. Anybody who can make Aliens and The Terminator is ok in my book. But to say Titanic is a great movie is overstepping the line. The effects were awesome and the attention to detail was great but the story was nothing but All My Children on a cruise ship. If I said it once, I'll say it a thousand times more. Boogie Nights was the best movie of 97, not Titanic.</div>",Negative
238,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Couldn't help but notice the number of posters that feel criticizing the movie-in any way-lumps you into a group of social misfits described as 'haters'. I thought the movie was fairly entertaining with outstanding special effects, but had a large problem with the lack of realism, especially ironic as Cameron 'got' most of the details correctly.<br/><br/>The 'love story' was patently ludicrous, but probably the thing that drove the numbers at the box office, the treatment of historical figures like 'Molly' Brown-for example-was appalling, dripping with misogyny.<br/><br/>With a little more even handed treatment the movie could have been outstanding and compelling to the degree that it actually deserved the Oscars it won that year, and still included a plausible romantic plot.</div>",Negative
239,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ultimate in awful blockbusters Titanic is a long , dull and slow-paced mess. The romantic relationship between the two leads is an obvious take on films like the African Queen however it comes across as terribly cliché making the audience cringe instead of cry although a few friends of mine did cry because of how awful they thought the film was. when we finally get to the sinking of the titanic we expect a spectacle we will never forget. The effect is good but it still doesn't make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The acting is dry, lacking any charisma and the result is like watching William Shatner for a few hours. Titanic really does not deserve the 11 academy awards it ""won""(clearly it was nominated by a group of shallow and insecure teenage girls).So far the only film that deserved that amount was Ben-Hur.</div>",Negative
240,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I avoided watching this movie for years and years, despite the entreaties of friends who insisted I would love it. Finally, many years after this was released, I capitulated and watched it with a friend. It was as bad as I had suspected. Overrated, predictable, overly sentimental and dull. I can't work out why so many people love it. It's a Hallmark movie on steroids.</div>",Negative
241,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic was one of the movies we walk into and know the basic outline of the plot before even taking our seat and watching the lights dim.  The Titanic is a legend, and it was an interesting idea to make a movie out of the true drama it was.  However, the poignant relationship between Jack and Rose failed to faze me at all; the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little.  I couldn't really empathize with such sappiness; I felt like the characters and even the whole 'tough love' story were unnecessarily cliche. Also, it took WAY too long.  Over an hour could have been cut while still making the point.  However, I think the scene with the musicians, and the scene with Andrew staring at his clock were quite sad and well-made; the rest of it is probably not worth the $2.00 rental fee.</div>",Negative
242,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Titanic"" is an average film at its best.  But certainly it is the most overrated movie in history.<br/><br/>OK, the visuals were great, and the last hour was exciting.  But the first two hours were nothing more than a routine, predictable love story that has been done over and over again.  Were you able to tell which characters would live and which would die the moment you first saw them enter the story?  If not, then you've only seen two or three movies in your entire life!<br/><br/>And that dialog!  Ugg!<br/><br/>Get to the theater late for this one.  Catch the last hour only.</div>",Negative
243,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The special effects are of course ground breaking and the main redeeming feature of this overblown epic.  Unfortunately the plot and the dialogue are immensely disappointing and cause one to twitch and turn away.  Motion sickness bags should have been provided.  Would it not have been so much better if the protagonists had been a little less black and white.  Then a masterpiece could have been built on that wonderful background of one of the most compelling tragedies of the 20th century.</div>",Negative
244,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film was alright and nothing more.  Granted, the effects were fantastic but that doesn't mean a lot.  The story was tired and not exactly original. What's worse is that Leonardo DiCaprio used to be excellent (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) but just phoned in his performance here.</div>",Negative
245,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's really nothing special. The first half of the film is incredibly dull and when the ship finally sinks, that really doesn't do anything for me either. It's a great performance by Leonardo and it's a shame he didn't get a nomination because that's the one this film truly deserved. Sure, the special effects were impressive but so were the effects in Predator. <br/><br/>AND, James Cameron once wrote a letter to the L.A. Times TELLING them to fire their film critic because he didn't like TItanic -- that's reason enough to hate him and this movie.</div>",Negative
246,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Only the effects redeem this film. From the ultra-quashy, and sickly love story, to the shameless stealing of countless scenes from the vastly superior British film, ""A Night to Remember,"" this film is a disgrace. What was James Cameron thinking? Pish-posh... Perhaps if they re-released an edited version, with the love story cut out, and the stolen scenes removed, it could be a good film. For anyone who likes this film, I urge you to see ""A Night to Remember."" (1958) It's listed here on IMDb. Check it out.</div>",Negative
247,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Is an overlong, occasionally entertaining, yarn which doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. Excellent special effects alone don't make a classic. You need good scripting and acting too. This is one of those films where you wish the dollars / pounds had not all been thrown at computer animation. It could have been so much better.</div>",Negative
248,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">..Flashy special effects...wooden characters..forgettable script...out of place(time) dialogue....unbelievable so-called one night stand 'romance'...pretty lead girl with no personality...pretty lead boy with no acting ability...this was the first Titanic movie I had seen until then(not a particularly interesting historical footnote to me at the time)...later I saw 'A Night To Remember' and remembered why I prefer older movies so much more than today's...ANTR is so much better in many respects..I saw this movie(Titanic) once in the theater and thought it was OK..saw part of it later on TV a while back...haven't seen it since and have nearly forgotten about it altogether...worth one viewing so you could comment on it but an obscenely huge waste of studio money...but the shallow, simpletons of today's time may think it is truly deep in nature..humor them...</div>",Negative
249,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mills &amp; Boon on a boat. Still love Leonardo though!</div>",Negative
250,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I still say LA Confidential, As Good as it Gets and Goodwill Hunting were robbed.  Ok, I´ll give the great scenery and effects, but please the story was so simple and lame I could have written it for 10th grade English.  If a movie is to be categorized a a truly great movie, it shouldn´t be about the money, it should be on how it advances movie-making. Heck give me the kind of money Cameron spent on this movie and I could pay 25% of my country´s foreign debt.  Wasted money on a nice looking but truly uninspiring film.</div>",Negative
251,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Great Thing to remember is this....they're many great epics out there that will hold up over the generations. It will take the education and guidance of film scholars and revival cinemas to preserve the true masterpieces. ""Titanic"", was meant to be and will always be remembered as 90's over-hyped fluff for the teen masses and over 50 year old that wanted a slice of old school Hollywood romance on the big screen. It is, what it is. The film is already dated. For true romantic epics, check out ""El Cid"", or ""Dr. Zhivago"". In closing, there's more to great epics than pretty faces and special effects. One day the masses will wake up and know a truly great film after its initial release. A Great film will hold up for decades. Immediate big box office does not mean long term classic or masterpiece. Titanic is far from either.</div>",Negative
252,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While the effects and acting were good I couldn't help but be disappointed by the cliched story.  Poor boy meets rich girl and everyone, from the boyfriend and his henchman (over-the-top villainy if ever I've seen it) to the snobbish mother, is desperate to stop them.  Come on - the ship is sinking and there's time for a chase scene complete with shooting! We've seen this story a hundred times, only the set (a good one at that) was different.</div>",Negative
253,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.</div>",Negative
254,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....</div>",Negative
255,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long. <br/><br/>Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio's case, shifted it up several notches).</div>",Negative
256,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature.</div>",Negative
257,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply put, Titanic is one of the most overrated movies of all time, in terms of how much money it made, how many people seem to like it, and how many awards it won. While the performances from Dicaprio (playing Jack), Winslet (playing Rose) and other supporting roles like the ship Captain are solid, the film on a whole just isn't. To sum up the film in one word would be ""boring"" or ""generic"". Titanic does't become the disaster movie until the very end, up until that its an extremely generic ""poor-boy-meets-rich-girl"" love story, something thats been done a billion times before. The film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect the times, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, the characters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husband to be, are just lazily written with no character other than ""I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff"". The film overall is just a bore, and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually starts sinking. Absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever. One of the most overrated movies of all time.</div>",Negative
258,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">..........that will get you through the interminable story and DeCaprio's horrible performance until the ship sinks......I can not comprehend why this movie was so popular.....and the nonsensical ending will have you chuckling to yourself</div>",Negative
259,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Anyone who loves movies will love this one (excepting horror-blood-war-my gun's bigger than yours fans). It has all the hallmarks of a movie classic. The special effects are relevant, the fictional plot cleverly wound into the real events, the romance versus drama well balanced, the acting persuasive. The stage settings and costumes were amazing. All the people who made this film know what they are doing - and it shows. It cleverly jerks out those tears and makes you stare in wonder. Good clean fun, I'd say. Go see it!</div>",Positive
260,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the movie with EVERYTHING.  If you have not seen this movie, you're missing out on a unique experience.  What I liked best about this movie is that every time I watch it I feel like I'm there with the characters, and that those characters are real people (some actually were). <br/><br/>This movie does have one flaw.  There are points in the movie where the dialogue becomes rather corny.  However, this can also work to the film's advantage to make you believe that it is taking place in a more naive time.</div>",Positive
261,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This Movie was stunning, and yes it did move me, but the fact that all these people are pretty much dead by now anyway, marred the whole tragidy part, so I liked the Special Effects. They really did catch the realizm of it all, and They Did pull the old heartstrings with the mother singing her Kids to sleep while a quartet played ""Nearer My God to Thee"", But I was in it for the intense Action: Miles of corridors filled with water, the Lights flickering out all at once, and the ship Breaking in half. that was cool</div>",Positive
262,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Although the script is not it's strong point, this film has many virtues. The directing is excellent, the acting is sober (Kate Winslet show us that she is a talented actress) and then comes the entertainment section in which ""Titanic"" is ""the king of the world"". From the moment that the iceberg hits the ship this film gets a new totally epic dimension. The scenes where Titanic splits in two are indeed visual poetry. In short, ""Titanic"" is a good film with a strong directing, an enormous attention to details but above all is an impressive visual spectacle.</div>",Positive
263,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This story was just your old-fashioned love story...nothing special.  The special effects were what made the movie.  That's where all the awards should have been won.  It got so graphic at times that I wished I was watching the 50's version with Clifton Webb.  We got to use our imagination back then.</div>",Positive
264,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok, I admit, I am a teenage girl and a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's. But despite him being in this picture, this film really isn't that bad. Maybe it didn't deserve all 11 of it's oscars (it doesn't compare to Ben-Hur) or over 1 billion at the box office. The acting isn't that great as the script is quite poor, but still the film doesn't deserve some of the comments it's received. It's entertaining and moving, and is worth watching if it's on. I think it deserved to get onto the Top 250 on this site, even if it shouldn't have got very high.</div>",Positive
265,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">movie was fantastic, sad and moving. about the true story of the white lines titanic. the ship that was unsinkable. kathy bates, and leonardo de caprio were excellent. i didnt go for kate winslet as rose. the love story was cleverly intermingled with the horrific sinking in the north atlantic,which changed shipping passenger line regulations forever. the class struggle was also exposed with the love affair of the two . and the damaging affect love has on your heart. great movie, but, a half an hour too long.</div>",Positive
266,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very good movie that was very well done by directing, writing, and casting. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Wilson did a good job. I'm not even their biggest fans but they were pretty good. I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in romance or the historic ship, Titanic.</div>",Positive
267,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay, as the hype for this movie built up, I was eagerly awaiting to see it. I mean, $200 million to MAKE a movie!??!  But, being a major James Cameron fan, I couldn't wait to see how he sank that ship.  So, for the first two hours, I watch this love story develop, anticipating the sinking.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was entertaining, and it really did not get in the way.  Then, BOOM!  The ship hit the iceberg, and the technical side of Cameron came out.  I was so impressed with the camera angles, the sound, and the visualization of the sinking.  This movie became so popular that it probably created a backlash by people who just can't stand to join the majority (well, news for you, you're still joining a group!), but I still enjoy watching this movie.</div>",Positive
268,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie obviously deserves to be in the Top 250. I'm surprised to see that 115,000 voters haven't enough sense to rate it higher than an 8. I'm sure it shouldn't be over 3 hours, but it does make good use of its screen time. It's in my Top 50, but I wish I could make myself not like it as much as I do. A 7.7 or 7.8, if it'll get it in the Top 250, but not very high up. This is one of the worst problems in the Top 250 right now. But it's the fact that it's a 7, not an 8, is my problem. It shouldn't really be high up. I would have totally different ideas to portray the Titanic. I'd still have a story centering around persons other than J. Bruce Ismay, Thomas Andrews and E.J. Smith. Although this movie does make good use of its time, I'd time it down an hour or so. My final rating: 8/10.</div>",Positive
269,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Have to just applaud boyo-2's comment there, it is a bizarre film this indeed.<br/><br/>I personally hate it, but if its on then I will watch it until the end, a true enigma of the film world.<br/><br/>For the trashy love story that goes on, there are enough pure heartfelt moments in the film to make u have some understanding of the tradegy that occurred.<br/><br/>You can never call this a bad film, just not what I for one, was expecting.<br/><br/>And lets be honest, I think James Cameron knows what he is doing, he will go far that boy!!</div>",Positive
270,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic holds 11 Oscars, the highest every grossing movie of all time and a critically acclaimed cinematic masterpiece. It took the world by storm in 1997 and still values plenty of positive credit to this day. To me, Titanic is no masterpiece, its a fictional love story on a real-life tragedy that struck in the youth years of the 20th century. Keep in mind there is terrific acting, excellent use of CGI and effects and some very suspenseful scenes not to mention the grueling emotions throughout the movie. Titanic created and extorted many famous memorable scenes to be remembered dearly in the future of the movie business. James Cameron directs a fine romantic movie, that was executed fantastically. The history, design and 'feel' was all accurate and that's one strong element that all other past Titanic movies didn't have. A fine movie with exquisite acting and detailed cinematography.</div>",Positive
271,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is easy to see why Titanic won so many Academy Awards. The special effects are incredible! I watched the movie on the TCM channel last week quite by accident. I had told myself that I would probably never see it because teen girls were seeing it a dozen times, and that made me a bit suspicious. I asked my wife if she had ever seen it. She said, like me, she had seen it on TV. My friends tell me that it is best seen in a big screen theater, but it is too late for that. Also, it is getting harder and harder to find big screen theaters. My wife, a reader, told me that it was not much of a movie. Her definition of a movie is one that fully develops the characters, and in the case of Titanic, the movie was just a vehicle for a love story between Leonardo and Kate. I was told that you could see the plot coming down the pike, and you could. I asked if it was not also the role of a movie just to entertain and was told that that is not enough. In thinking about what I was told I could appreciate that Titanic was not a great movie, but it was sure entertaining and jaw dropping, and I am not just talking about the sketching scene.</div>",Positive
272,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a movie that will never happen again a love story that is timeless with some scenes that you will never forget. The doomed ship called Titanic the unsinkable ship is the back drop for a love story that is unforgettable. James Cameron directs an amazing film which made stars out of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet it is one you will not forget. There is very little action but the social divide that comes between the main characters and one that they must overcome in order to be together. Titanic is a movie that you will watch again and again and it will amaze you more and more each time the lovers come together and you know it can never last as everybody knows the fate of the Titanic. A must see for romance adventure and history it deserves its place in movie history.</div>",Positive
273,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watch this movie with this with great enthusiasm in 3D but it Don't reach that vigor and value of effects as in Avatar 3D as I consider that James would Repeat such Great effects in This movie but it looks like same old movie Well we are watching lot of 3D movies completely shot in 3D we always expect the thrill delivered by effects none of it meant as it on screen i Mean May be James want to show this movie again under the name of 3D but my valued suggestion if anyone have not watched this movie go watch it now but for 3D don't go it will leave you faded faces and boring talks lets well I may hope that in future may be if JC is willing to re-release any such kind of movies he better may think of effects side</div>",Positive
274,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is the second film to win 11 Oscars , before only Ben- Hur classic had this done, Titanic is a great movie , more will it deserved both Oscar ?, the film photography is beautiful , the costume is also good, the performances are very good, and the cast is good, the couple Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio works , the more the film has some unnecessary characters , the soundtrack of James Horner is excellent , and the script is well written , the film is too long has more three hours, and the pace leaves the film through tiring , the direction of Cameron is great , Titanic is a great film with good performances and a beautiful soundtrack, with a slow pace that leaves the tiresome film, I do not particularly give 11 Oscars I believe that the film deserved a maximum of 6 Oscars . Note 8.3</div>",Positive
275,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie will never get old. It is more beautiful every time I watch it.</div>",Positive
276,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""I don't even have a portrait of him, but he will always live in my heart."" Dare to say that this is a movie I have always loved.</div>",Positive
277,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like this movie very much. It's very good and very macro. The hero is very handsome and has a feeling of love.</div>",Positive
278,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Heart of the Sea is a jeweled necklace. It is the color of the ocean. Most people would think it is precious but Rose, the main character, gets it as a gift and doesn't care about it. Rose's mother wants her to marry Caledon Hockley for the money. On the Titanic, Rose gets the Heart of the Sea as a gift from him.<br/><br/>It is interesting that the two main characters in this movie are in opposite places in their lives. Rose feels trapped. Rose's family comes from money. She meets and falls in love with a boy named Jack. Jack is poor, gambles, and moves around a lot. Rose starts to change after spending time with Jack. He is like a role model.<br/><br/>I would say age appropriateness for the movie is 9-10 and up. It has some sadness, a little bit of violence, and nudity. I rate it 8 out of 10 stars. I hope you enjoy the movie.</div>",Positive
279,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think that although the film focuses on love, it also reflects the ugliness of class relations
When the Titanic was about to sink, almost all the opportunities for survival were reserved for the aristocratic class. The poor could only pray for the rest of the ship to give their children or face death silently
This is a criticism of the ruling class of that era and a satire that the poor and the rich were treated differently</div>",Positive
280,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This cruise ship is like the European society in miniature at that time, in this cruise ship people were divided into three or six classes, aristocrats live in the first class, enjoy the best social resources, at the top of the pyramid. Even though there were 12 people in the room, they still felt very crowded, which was in sharp contrast to the life of the people at the bottom of the boiler room on the cruise ship.</div>",Positive
281,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film has always been famous, but I have not been to see, knowing that the classic section of the inside is not as deep as the whole feeling. you jump,i jump Jack I'll Never Let up These two sentences are the most touching words I've ever seen in my whole play, all Jack said to Ruth. The first sentence is Jack rescued Ruth from the railing said, is the first encounter shallow love. The second sentence is when life and death depend on each other Jack's advice to Ruth, never give up the hope of living, is love after love deeply. Maybe you gave me a different feeling, made me like you, can not say why, but you are just different from others. No matter what happens, you'll always be the one in my heart.</div>",Positive
282,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really love this movie.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have excellent chemestry.<br/><br/>Whatever cheesiness this movie may have works in its favor, because it makes the later scenes so much more impactful.<br/><br/>I always forget how terrifying and depressign the second half is.<br/><br/>That shot of the old couple laying on the bed...
It destroys me every single time.<br/><br/>What a wonderful film.</div>",Positive
283,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Classic movie through and through. This movie is amazing. It allows for a great performance with the duo of two great performers.<br/><br/>Sad, beautiful, heartfelt.<br/><br/>And the one thing people don't appreciate is that it was told in the past tense. It was from the lens of Rose as an elderly women.<br/><br/>Just an overall classic movie with excellent scenes and amazing scripting.</div>",Positive
284,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply a dazzling movie!  The special effects are top notch and I loved the story line! =)<br/><br/>The ending with the camera going over the pictures in the old lady's room makes my eyes water every single time!  Kudos!<br/><br/>Definately a must see movie not because it's 'popular' but because it's superbly written and directed!</div>",Positive
285,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A great epic. A movie that will always have a special place in my heart. Why? Because it is one of the few movies that made me cry.</div>",Positive
286,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As usual, I didn't get caught up in the hysteria and watch this film when it came out, instead waiting for the film to arrive on TV.  I must say, I expected trash and instead was profoundly affected by the film.  I thought the acting was very good, a good performance from Di Caprio, and Kate Winslet was positively gorgeous.  I see many commenters say they observed closely Di Caprio's acting and didn't like it, but why watch a film to ""observe"" the acting?  Acting is good when you don't notice it's acting.  A script is good when you don't notice any bad lines.  If you look specifically for things then you'll watch a film in an artificial manner and find all sorts of things.  Titanic is to be enjoyed, for many reasons.  The romance is sublime, the special effects are dazzling, the way classes were treated so differently is shocking, the tragedy of seeing those passengers perish is haunting and stayed with me for a couple of days afterwards.  All in all Titanic is a powerful film, well directed, and for me, deserved many of the oscars it received.  For once the hollywood blockbuster movie was worth the millions spent on it.</div>",Positive
287,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a good movie for people who like history, ship wreaks, romance, drawings, pretty necklaces, and more! Leo is so hot in this movie! Rose Calvert does excellent storytelling. Also the costumes are gorgeous! This movie also makes us feel sorry for the people who died on Titanic, and feel happy for the people who survived. James did a good job with the directing. The script was well. I would give this 10 out of 10!</div>",Positive
288,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw Titanic again just now, and I can say I enjoyed every moment of it. Showing the old wreck, the -now very old- female survivor, the bringing back of memories and actually being there, wonderful! A True Masterpiece!!!  Even the love story holds up, where so many people try to dish this part of the movie.  Ok, so Di Caprio isn't overly talented, but Kate is a marvel, and the story-line interweaves the dramatic love story very grippingly with the even more dramatic impending doom of 1500+ on board who cannot get out.<br/><br/>This used to be my no. 2 all-time favorite, after Schindler's List, but now the first 2 LOTR movies make it my current no. 4.  And well deserved.<br/><br/>This movie aged much better than f.i. Jurassic Park does.</div>",Positive
289,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Titanic"" is an excellent movie! It's very dramatic, emotional, overwhelming, magnificent,... I was really impressed when I saw this movie, and I don't think I can say anything negative about it. Some people say that in the whole first half of the movie nothing happens. I don't think that way about ""Titanic"". From the first moment the two saw each other, you felt there were already sparks between them. Also the music is véry beautiful! This is a fascinating movie: it's dramatic, gripping, emotional, sometimes exciting, the acting is also good, the music is marvelous. One of the best movies ever made! If you haven't seen it, you should try to see it as soon as you can! Excellent work from director James Cameron, the whole cast and the whole crew!</div>",Positive
290,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic was a movie that was based on the tragedy, and a fictional love story. The beginning of the film is interesting yet it lacks a little bit. However as the film goes on and reaches the climax, the film starts to make you feel worried, and love the characters. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet did an awesome job playing the characters, and James Cameron really proved to be an awesome director. The effects were so real and so awesome that there is no word. This movie won the right deserved best picture title. This is James Cameron's best film, and the post converted 3d release in 2012 won't fail to capture the heart of Titanic fans.</div>",Positive
291,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's been 14 years. And I am still nostalgia with this love movie.Every time when the prelude of MY HEART WILL GO ON played, all of the beautiful scenes will automatically and slowly play through my mind. It is like a story belonging to a very distant past and no longer exist any more.<br/><br/>Young Leonardo and Kate are really perfect couple. Jack and rose, they are full of passion,strong and honest.Dare you chase for your love by losing your life? dare you say to your lover that ""you jump I jump""?Think it over, dare you? Maybe we are looking for love, or we have been engaged or married to someone,but most of us lost romantic sense.We seldom taste the favor that love brings to us.Well,this movie really recall my memories about young love.So beautiful.<br/><br/>Can't wait for 3D TITANIC!</div>",Positive
292,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is not one movie James Cameron makes that is not worth watching ...
He is the second most perfectionist director that ever lived.
Nobody will probably ever beat the undisputable number one.. Stanley Kubrik</div>",Positive
293,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What can be said about this film what wasent already been told,titanic is masterpiece in a filmaking and every scene is beautiful and made with a lot of skills,before rewatching this film i thought since it pased a lot of time since i watched titanic that this film is over hyped and overrated,but how wrong i was,leo and kate are iconic in this film and they had one of best chemistries ever put on screen,even minor characters in this film felt imprortant to plot and they put a mark on their characters,also this film is also sad i know that people consider that line cliched but it is true,titanic is defienetly one of most remarkable films of all time and also one of most hardest made and achivable in every ways of making it</div>",Positive
294,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I only watched this film many years later, and its theme song was an eternal classic.</div>",Positive
295,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I saw for the very first time «Titanic» and this is still my favorite movie. It is just a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
296,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The old couple fearless of death, the band undisturbed by the outside world, the man who made a living as a false father, the woman who whistled for her lover. All for a kind of mental persistence.</div>",Positive
297,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.</div>",Positive
298,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cameron skillfully used the shipwreck of the ""century shipwreck"" Titanic as a traction, realism and romantic feelings complement each other, cleverly implanted romantic and Humanistic Love Tragedy, and created a magnificent film Titanic.
In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the sad and beautiful love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely provocative and tearful. The story starts with the search for ""the heart of the sea"", with the narration of Ruth, an old survivor of the shipwreck, as the introduction, and uses the flashback to introduce the audience into the mood of an involuntary role replacement. It's wonderful to follow the characters.</div>",Positive
299,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It 's enough to have this kind of love once in a lifetime, because you could remember the emotions and beautiful memories for the rest of your life.</div>",Positive
300,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When the song 'Heart Will Go On' came on during this film all I could think about was Kate Winslet's breasts jiggling all over the place, hence 'her heart underneath those breasts going on'. I also like the positive outlook this film has on betting which makes me more comfortable with my gambling and Kate Winslet also looks a lot like my sister so that made Kate all the more sexy for my sausage and love balls.</div>",Positive
301,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just recently saw this film again and I must saw it holds up! A friend was putting this film down and I couldn't disagree more. The effects still shine bright! The music is unforgettable, and Leo and Kate are just so lovely. It does get a little silly here and there, but those are just minor gripes. This movie gives you the feels!<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you have seen it, watch it, watch it, watch it!</div>",Positive
302,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jack Dawson (Leo Dicaprio) plays a 3rd class passenger that wins his ticket in a lucky game of poker. Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) plays a troubled 1st class girl who is forced into a marriage because of her family's bankruptcy. But when her troublesome explodes she finds herself on the back of the ship preparing to jump. As a witness, Jack comes up and persuades her with sarcasm. After that night she got more then a rescuer, she found her love. And he will go with her all the way to the bottom of the sea.</div>",Positive
303,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let me say right off- I'm a girl/19, but I can't even pronounce Leonardo's last name.  I finally saw Titanic like the last week it was in theaters.  I kept saying 'naugh, not now' because I thought it would be a teeny-bopper movie with a lot of cute people in it.  Well.. yes and no.  Yeah there's cute people in it (Billy Zane is the cutest :p) but this movie has a lot going for it.  *Great* writing, seamless directing, appropriate musical scores, great acting, bleah bleah bleah.  I've wasted enough of your time. I give it a 9/10; missing the 10 only because I'm so sick of that damn Titanic song!!</div>",Positive
304,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perhaps not a fully correct historically, bit what a tear jerker, at least for the first half dozen times you watch it. I remember when I went to the cinema for the first time to watch this film at the close, no one, not anyone said a word; all we could hear was sobbing. The film certainly made its impact.</div>",Positive
305,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie.<br/><br/>Thanks Dean Scheu</div>",Positive
306,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The portrait of a disaster, the colourful description of a love affair, the memory of so many lost souls on the biggest sea disaster ever. A classic soundrack by James Horner and a great theme song given by Ms Celine Dion. Although not a fan of Mr. DiCaprio, I must admit that in this film his acting is very good indeed. Together with Ms Winslet, they managed to sweep the viewers into the the world of Titanic with wonderful shots on the ship. The viewer has to be prepared for a long film as it portrays many aspects of the passengers lives including love scenes between Caprio and Winslet. If you havent seen it yet then wait no more.</div>",Positive
307,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this was the shortest 3 hours I have ever sat through a movie. This movie made you want to watch and then rewind and watch again. Kate Winslet's best work, all the roles were cast perfectly. I would suggest this movie to anyone. I don't usually watch love stories but I couldn't stop watching this one. A solid 9 out of 10.</div>",Positive
308,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was very good, just too long! Probably many potential viewers were discouraged by the length. The producers should have researched and edited more,(See goofs for Titanic)but the producers wanted it out! All in all, a good movie. Enjoyable, because of good casting.</div>",Positive
309,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In 1912, the Titanic was a technological triomph, and it is again today.  James Cameron is one of the greatest people that ever lived, he is right up there with George Lucas and Jim Hensen.  The completion of that movie was nothing short of sheer greatness.  The dramatic camera effects all the way to the computerized extra's, titanic is almost the greatest movie ever made. Now, the reason I say almost, is because there just had to be a Nudie' scene, to ruin it for everybody with standards.  I myself would not even see it until I was able to purchase it and have it edited, but it was immensely worth the trouble of getting it edited. Now the movie would not be near as great without the strong effort on the soundtrack side(JAMES HORNER).<br/><br/>The music fits the movie more perfectly then any other movie I have ever seen in my life.  James Horner is probably the greatest composer the lived</div>",Positive
310,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I am sure that many of the negative reviews this movie has received are sincerely meant, I can't resist adding that I think Titanic has suffered, more or less unfairly, from its tremendous box-office success.  It is always hard to like a winner, and this makes it  difficult to give this film, both over-rated by some and under-rated by others, a fair assessment. I can only say that I feel that for all its obvious shortcomings, Titanic is an exceptional film.  At roughly three-hours of running time, the movie never feels long and is never dull.  It is both funny and genuinely moving by turns.  Whether intentionally or not, James Cameron has endowed the characters and situations in this film with a simplicity and a monumental resonance worthy of a great Nineteenth-century melodrama.  While it is not one of the greatest films of all time, Titanic is nevertheless an magnificent production well worth repeated viewings.</div>",Positive
311,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really stayed away from this movie when it came out but I just saw it for the first time the other day and it is really really good, the thing about this movie is, its not just the story of a big ship that sinks but is more about the lifestyles of the rich and the famous back in that time period and also a love story tied in there, The Ship is just in the background while the people on board are the real story. I really like DiCaprio's Character full of spirit and energy good attitude towards life he's a great Actor and James Cameron is a fine Director I do give this movie a 5 out of 5 great story and very entertaining you should watch this movie if you' never seen it before any one who likes a great movie will like this one</div>",Positive
312,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! Leonardo and Kate really shine as a starving artist and a beautiful rich girl! I thought that Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first met Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The one person I really couldn't stand was Cal (Billy Zane). This was because he was very conceited, arrogant, and controlling of the woman he loved. Plus, he chased after Jack and Rose, attempting to kill them. If I were Rose, I would have told Cal that the wedding's off. Other than that, this film really touched me and made me feel good. In conclusion, to all you Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet fans who haven't seen TITANIC, go to the video store, buy it or rent it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it, or your money back.</div>",Positive
313,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic was a great movie. One of my favorites. But it's not 100% accurate, and I'm not talking about the goofs (mess ups). On the discovery channel there was a topic about the titanic. And People believe that the titanic sank because the iceberg hit the side of the ship. Now there is evidence that states the iceberg hit the side and the bottom. So therefore, however many hours they say it took the ship to sing is actually half of that. I'm not sure how many hours they had before the ship sank but for ExAmPLe if it was 3 they only had one in a half. So please comment on this I would love to hear what you have to say. But, overall Great Movie.</div>",Positive
314,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of the most popular movie. When you watch this movie for the first time, you are probably going to be sad. It's been created in a wonderful way and I'm sure that if James Cameron has the same equipment that helped him to create Avatar, he would have created this movie in an incredible way. The only weak spot is James had not given a space to talk about other people who had died in that disaster. He had concentrated on Rose and Jack. In my opinion, if he did not do that mistake, this movie was going to be better than The Shawshank Redemption which is the best movie. I want to talk about the music. It was really awesome and what made it like this because he chose one of the best composers who is James Horner. Another strong point was its plot. It was organized correctly. the greatest thing in Titanic movie was its end. A protagonist who is Jack had died and he chose that to save his lover. It was the first time that I saw the end like this.</div>",Positive
315,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am sure everyone has seen this movie in a part of their life. If you watched it when you were young, please watch it again because it is the defenition of a masterpiece. Altough Di Caprio and Winslet were on their early ages, they were fantastic. Chemistry was as good as it can be. Exquisite writing. When the movie is based on a real story it is harder to be creative. James Cameron did a spectacular job in writing and his world-class directing, because of him we are able to call this movie a classic. Amazing visual effects especially for 1997. It deserves every attention it has gotten. After all every one of 11 Oscars is not a suprise at all.</div>",Positive
316,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's ""Titanic"" to me.A perfect summary of the american cinema.The breakfast of Cal and Rose is like the breakfast in Citizen Kane(Kane and her wife).The face of Leonardo DiCaprio at the bottom of the starcaise is like Clark Gable in ""Gone with the wind"" and the irish party in third class is like the John Ford movies.Seeing ""Titanic"",you can see the cinema of David Wark Griffith ,John Ford or David O'Selznick(Gone with the wind producer).The only reason to critic this movie are its simple dialogues that,sometimes seem ridiculous.The rest is epic,romance,adventure and a great lesson of cinema.The ""Gone with the wind ""of this era. People usually hate this movie because of its great success(is the number one in historic top office)but is not a bad movie.The plot is simple but i think the ritm of the movie is great.Is a classic love story of two youngs.I think is wonderful,a really masterpiece underrated by titanic-phenomenon.If you like the cinema ,see this movie.</div>",Positive
317,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everyone's seen this movie, so I'll omit any introduction and head straight to specific comments. I thought the plot twist of hand-cuffing Jack below deck of the sinking ship and managing to free him and still yet managing to make it back up despite the freezing water was way too much. Also, the Gallagher character and his stooge were too predictable in their badness. Nevertheless, Titanic delivers a visual and conceptual whallop that lingers on in the memory and imagination.</div>",Positive
318,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know why Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his role in the movie?  Simple:  His acting was not very good, and at times it was the equivalent of some of the performances one might see on an after school special.  That will keep this film from holding the title ""Greatest of All Time.""  I still say that Titanic was not even the best movie of 1997.  That should have gone to ""LA Confidential.""  But that argument is for another time....</div>",Positive
319,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that Titanic was a very good movie from my mouth, but it is. Leonardo DiCaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. This movie was very well created with excellent art-direction and cenematography. The sinking of the ship in this movie is so good, that when I saw it in the theaters I almost felt that I was in the middle of the Atlantic on a huge sinking ship. This movie wasn't the best movie of 1997, LA Confidential was that. Still Titanic may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects I've ever seen. **** out of **** for Titanic.</div>",Positive
320,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think Titanic is a very interesting movie. Indeed it depicts a true story and we really feel as if we were living the story. The details are very realistic and the special effects great. Moreover, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play very well and the idea of making the film around a love story is pretty good.</div>",Positive
321,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While the story was predictable.  What better way to take us all over the ship.  We saw how the rich lived aboard the ship right down to the poor. We saw how the poor were treated horribly by being locked in.  Even though it was acting we could get an  idea of how frightening it must have been for the victims of this tragedy.  So I feel that this movie accomplished what it set out to do . Sure sometimes it becomes cliche.  But in the end we learned how people thought in that time.  And most importantly the mistakes that were made that contributed to this tragedy, that are not allowed to be made today</div>",Positive
322,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I voted a 9/10, partly because the romance DID drag on a bit too long. The ship didn't hit the iceberg until 1 1/2 hours through the movie. After seeing this movie 3 times in the theatre, I was very bored with it, but reluctantly bought it on tape anyways. It CAN be considered a masterpiece, however. The acting was very good. The story could have used several improvements to keep it more interesting.<br/><br/>After the ship hit the iceberg, things got exciting. This was the part of the movie I really enjoyed. Those who didn't see it in the theatre can never get the real feel of the movie, when the screams are blasting at you, it was exciting.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you rent it and sit down, at least through the boring first part, until the ship starts sinking and it gets interesting.</div>",Positive
323,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I liked this movie.  I thought the reproduced ship was remarkable.  To reenact that night was tough to do and they did it. It's one of those movies in which you laugh and cry.  The only other thing was Leo looks about 15 and Kate Winslet looks about 25.  Wonderful movie though!</div>",Positive
324,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of those movies where the cinematography is one of the main highlightes. The ship sinking is awesome and best seen in either the big screen or in widescreen format. That scene and the budding romance between Leo &amp; kate make up the vast majority of this film-about 97% of it. The movie certainly made a heartthrob of Leo! See this movie if just for the ship sinking part. Young &amp; the Restless fans can spot Eric Braeden (Victor) as John J. Astor, and of course Leo, Kate, and Kathy Bates (Molly Brown) are recognizable, as is Billy Zane.<br/><br/>*** out of ****</div>",Positive
325,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Considering 'Titanic' is a truly Hollywood-esque movie, one is not the least bit surprised at the amount of historical inaccuracy present.  Regardless of these various (and numerable) mistakes, 'Titanic' still proves to be a highly enjoyable and moving film.  <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio perform well as the main characters of a love story backdropped by the sailing of the doomed vessel.  Kathy Bates is excellent as the ""Unsinkable Molly Brown,"" and Frances Fisher performs well as the arrogant, love-to-hate mother of Winslet's character.<br/><br/>The special effects, including a near life-size replica of the ship, are great.  The film would be enjoyable to watch simply to see the magnificence of the oceanliner itself.  The soundtrack to this film is brilliant as well.</div>",Positive
326,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is unfortunate, but I believe this film was over hyped and therefore received some extreme levels of criticism. Additionally, it didn't help that when the movie was being marketed for VHS, it was deemed ""the best movie of all time"". Out of all of the 200 million dollar movies made, I believe this one beats out LOTR. I think this movie was able to capture a wider audience (yes, the demographics did shift towards the 18 years or younger females), but this is a movie you can watch with your grandma or your little sister. Historical accuracy was pretty good with a little bit of Hollywood (murdoch shooting people and himself, as debated by his relatives). I still think this is an important film and won't get the respect it deserves until fifty or even one hundred years down the road. A true masterpiece in film.</div>",Positive
327,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">...the script is dire, the storyline obvious and the special effects not entirely convincing but there is something about this film that means I simply have to give it a good grade - I owe it to the 17-year-old girl I was when it was released who saw it four times at the cinema. I was addicted to it, as was my most cynical of friends. The combination of an already compelling story about one of the worst disasters in maritime history, attractive leads in Winslet and Di Caprio and a ashamedly gushy script means it assaults the emotions, captures the imagination and made it one of - if not the - biggest films in the history of cinema. A part of me does wonder if it was right to make a film about this, especially given James Cameron's egocentric obsession with it; my grandfather won't even watch it as he grew up in Ireland in the years following the catastrophe and it was very much mourned there. But the thing is that it was made and did its job very, very well. I bet you you know exactly what I mean!</div>",Positive
328,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm a thirteen year old girl and when I saw this movie about three weeks ago I fell in love with it, its now one of my favorites. I've seen it 5 times since and think it is a great movie to just watch on those sad rainy days.Its a real tear jerker when I saw it I cried the whole ending.. about 45 minutes of the movie. Its long but when your watching it your just so into the movie you don't realize how long its really been. Me and all my friends love this movie and even a couple of my guy friends love the movie too. Its a great movie for anyone to watch. My little sister who is three watched it with me and loved it too. This movie was based on something that really happened with sometime that could of and that really makes it more interesting to watch because of the fact this might of been how two lovers lives were changed and the ending is a perfect way to finish the story. This was the cutest movie I've seen.</div>",Positive
329,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The love scene in the auto in the cargo hold is absolutely innocuous but man is it hot. I rate it as up there with Superman flying Lois lane. Nothing dirty just quite erotic. The facts of the movie were excellent for the time but as research progresses it becomes more and more likely the dramatic stern rise before final sinking did not actually take place. Too bad as that was excellent drama and probably why that version of the sinking was chosen. Victor Newman/Hans/Eric Braeden/rat patrol German Officer deserved more screen time. Why waste/edit a big name nearly out of the picture. To all those that slam the picture-Get a Life-it is good drama and the effects are enough to keep anyones attention. Jacks death scene is probably one of the best ever filmed.</div>",Positive
330,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Over the years many have tried hard to criticize this film. But if you will give your naughty mind a little rest then you can easily accept that its a masterpiece. James cameroon have done tremendous labor to make this film look so good. And actors of course have done a mind blowing job throughout the movie. Lets start with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well everyone knows that he has got some serious acting skills because it wasn't the first film where he has given a outstanding performance. And the same thing goes with the Kate winslet. She looked one hell of a beauty. I know many of you out there would have thought how can anyone look so .....its tough to describe how well she looked in this movie. <br/><br/>Anyways for those who have not seen this movie yet or who did not liked this movie..""THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU GUYS""</div>",Positive
331,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.</div>",Positive
332,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Someone needs to write a dissertation on the audience reaction to this movie.  When it came out, almost everyone loved it and many people saw it multiple times, yet after it won the Oscars, suddenly you weren't cool unless you hated Titanic with a passion.  I don't understand this at all. Maybe it was too successful for its own good, or maybe it was just Cameron's a-hole acceptance speech, but the way the audience has flip-floped on this film is amazing.  Personally, I think it's a great movie.  The dialogue is bad, but otherwise there's nothing terrible about it.  If you don't like it, I can see rating it at 6 or so, but how could over 7,000 people truly believe Titanic deserves a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10?  I mean, COME ON!</div>",Positive
333,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film i loved it. People should go and see it because it's entertaining and the acting were really professional from both parts. Even though it is long it doesn't bore you because of the content it has. This movie made Leonardo Di Caprio become a superstar and put Kate Winslet into the stardom. And in every single magazine they appeared. Such a great romantic story, That gathered lots of money, And had 11 Oscar's nominations. Fantastic performances. Cool. The director James Cameron made a great job guiding this fabulous characters in such a real Story. Great directing and art direction. Kate Winslet show everyone she can actually act, and being a real professional she lost weight. Amazing No words to describe how i felt. China Sursa Fanny</div>",Positive
334,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Inspired by the wreckage of the Titanic, James Cameron evolved a sailing legend into a breathtaking love story. Cameron said: ""In our collective imagination, the tragedy of the Titanic has almost become a myth. With the passage of time, the humanity and vitality contained in it have disappeared. I hope that the love between Rose and Jack can be Become a beacon of emotion, let the audience devote their whole heart and witness the reappearance of history. ""</div>",Positive
335,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The sinking of the Titanic made Jack and Rose Immortal in their love. The most beautiful love often has regrets. Without long-term love, the eternal love is gone. James Cameron tells us in a fragmentary form: believe in love. But at the same time, it also implies that without eternal love, no matter how beautiful love is, it can't rival life.</div>",Positive
336,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Basically, no one in the world has not seen this movie! It can be said that the most famous love movie of the 21st century. Leonardo is famous for this film. Everyone knows Kate's heart of the ocean. The director shouted at the Oscar ceremony, ""I am the king of the world! ""This movie is a must-see movie for fans who love movies since the 21st century.</div>",Positive
337,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Of course it's probably said before, this movie is a must watch, captivating cinematography with heart breaking scenes that will make you run into the other room to check on your partner.</div>",Positive
338,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Real love is the collision of soul, crossing the gap between the rich and the poor and life and death. Moved by the love of the protagonists and heroines, but also moved by the love of other small people in the context of the shipwreck.</div>",Positive
339,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In the background of Titanic shipwreck, the love between rose and Jack is an important stroke in the history of film. The movie not only narrates the love at first sight that spans the gap between the rich and the poor, but also sings an elegy for the touching story that life and death follow at the critical moment. At the same time, in the context of the shipwreck, countless characters on the Titanic face death, some of them are afraid of fear, some of them are calm, and some of them are also amazing.</div>",Positive
340,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Is a matter of fact, the true love can go beyond the money, go beyond life, although at the end of the film, there are a lot of people want to salvage the priceless jewel, but Ruth finally threw the jewel in the ""Titanic"" sunken place, at the end of the film, unfortunately, the gem didn't appear in the eyes of the world!</div>",Positive
341,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""I figure life is gift and i don't intend on wasting it.You never know what hand you're going to get dealt next.You learn to take life as it comes at you. ""</div>",Positive

344,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's ""Titanic"" to me.A perfect summary of the american cinema.The breakfast of Cal and Rose is like the breakfast in Citizen Kane(Kane and her wife).The face of Leonardo DiCaprio at the bottom of the starcaise is like Clark Gable in ""Gone with the wind"" and the irish party in third class is like the John Ford movies.Seeing ""Titanic"",you can see the cinema of David Wark Griffith ,John Ford or David O'Selznick(Gone with the wind producer).The only reason to critic this movie are its simple dialogues that,sometimes seem ridiculous.The rest is epic,romance,adventure and a great lesson of cinema.The ""Gone with the wind ""of this era. People usually hate this movie because of its great success(is the number one in historic top office)but is not a bad movie.The plot is simple but i think the ritm of the movie is great.Is a classic love story of two youngs.I think is wonderful,a really masterpiece underrated by titanic-phenomenon.If you like the cinema ,see this movie.</div>",Positive
345,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everyone's seen this movie, so I'll omit any introduction and head straight to specific comments. I thought the plot twist of hand-cuffing Jack below deck of the sinking ship and managing to free him and still yet managing to make it back up despite the freezing water was way too much. Also, the Gallagher character and his stooge were too predictable in their badness. Nevertheless, Titanic delivers a visual and conceptual whallop that lingers on in the memory and imagination.</div>",Positive
346,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know why Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his role in the movie?  Simple:  His acting was not very good, and at times it was the equivalent of some of the performances one might see on an after school special.  That will keep this film from holding the title ""Greatest of All Time.""  I still say that Titanic was not even the best movie of 1997.  That should have gone to ""LA Confidential.""  But that argument is for another time....</div>",Positive
347,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that Titanic was a very good movie from my mouth, but it is. Leonardo DiCaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. This movie was very well created with excellent art-direction and cenematography. The sinking of the ship in this movie is so good, that when I saw it in the theaters I almost felt that I was in the middle of the Atlantic on a huge sinking ship. This movie wasn't the best movie of 1997, LA Confidential was that. Still Titanic may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects I've ever seen. **** out of **** for Titanic.</div>",Positive
348,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think Titanic is a very interesting movie. Indeed it depicts a true story and we really feel as if we were living the story. The details are very realistic and the special effects great.

In fact, the one bad thing anyone had to say about this in 1997 was that the dialogue wasn't up to scratch.  Excuse me?  How many quotable lines? `She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can sink.' `I'm the king of the world!' `We are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen. But we would like a brandy.' `You unimaginable bastard!'  This film is a true classic in the old-fashioned sense of the word.</div>",Positive
372,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would say that this is truthfully one of the best movies I have ever seen. It came out when I was only 7, and, of course, I was not mature enough to understand what was going on. Watching it now, I can't possibly imagine how anyone could not like this movie.<br/><br/>Every time you watch it it just gets better. The movie is incredibly layered, and you always see things you didn't the last time you watch it. I definitely would give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars, because it honestly deserves it. A good movie to watch to anyone who hasn't seen it, although, that is something else about this movie, everyone has seen it, which just goes to show how good it truly is.</div>",Positive

374,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't get me wrong, I love the titanic but the historical inaccuracies really annoy me. like the fact that when the ship went under you could see the word Liverpool written on it but it merely sailed from Liverpool, it was created and built in Belfast. also for a ship created in northern Ireland there was English, Scottish, Irish and even welsh accents in it but not one northern Ireland accent which is strongly different from the rest, which fails to show the true origins of the film and i have to say i feel cheated!! (i am from NI) that being said i don't think that Cameron's aim was to show the history but to in fact show the emotion of the event which he does very successfully. definitely worth the tears i shed every time i watch it!!</div>",Positive
375,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved when this movie first came out in theaters, I loved it on in that bulky VHS box, I loved it on DVD and well...you guessed it, I love it on Blu-Ray. some of the negative reviews are saying they had issues with either sound or playback. My BD played all the way through, from beginning to end without any issues OTHER THAN one small freeze up between a particular chapter change. I don't think I lost more than a second or two. It could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge. Either way I'm not complaining. It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie. So glad that I can own it in such high definition. It looks and sounds great. You see every detail of every scene like never before. They really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible, and we're talking about a movie that came out in the late 90's. Oh! And the commentaries and special features are great, STILL haven't gotten through all of them. Maybe I'll do that now...enjoy.</div>",Positive
376,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.<br/><br/>I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.</div>",Positive
377,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all how could you people give this movie such a low score, i have seen a lot of sad movies and this is the first to ""almost"" make me cry. I'm shocked that you gave this masterpiece a 7/10 and think just because this is a ""chick flick"" about a forbidden romance on a big ship that sinks, is that its going to bomb. I think that some people who haven't even seen this movie have voted for it, and i strongly suggest you don't do that to be accepted by others. The acting in this movie was excellent, Kate Winslet, and Leo's chemistry was obviously visible. The writing for this film was extraordinary. The effects for the sinking of this ship was just incredible, and this movie let you bond with everyone, even people you didn't know. When the ship sinks and everyone dies you feel sorry for them. My opinion watch this movie it is very enjoyable and i liked it.</div>",Positive
378,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phenomenal film. The thematically rich epic love story that never gets old and still one of the highest hollywood achievements of all time.</div>",Positive
379,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok, yes I'm a guy, and yes good guys cry.   Well, actually I didn't, because the movie was so hyped up about the emotions and everything I went into it with no emotions.   But, believe me, the two friends I went with were bawling their eyes off.  I have to admit I had to swallow my throat a number of times.  This movie is moving and it takes you there.  Literally. Exactly what movies are supposed to do, create an escape from reality. Cameron has done an excellent job, and the acting was IMHO great too. I don't know anyone personally, that has not enjoyed watching this movie.  If you haven't yet, rent it.   It's worth every penny.  I'd buy it, but I'm waiting for the DVD.</div>",Positive
380,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie Titanic had very neat and incredible special effects. It even had a bit for everyone- romance, suspense, action, and comedy. The movie was very touching, and you could sympathize with all the characters.</div>",Positive
381,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and superbly directed by James Cameron, is truly a beautiful story. The Film tells the story of the Titanic from a different perspective. Leonardo Plays Jack, as poor young man who just managed to get onto the Titanic, and Kate Winslet plays Rose, a rich young lady, whom with Jack does she fall in love DiCaprios acting is fantastic, same goes for Winslet. <br/><br/>A lot of people complain about their acting, saying it's cheesy and cheap. Well I have one thing to say to those people, and that is that the acting is Supposed to be cheesy. It's a Melodrama, and it's not trying to win Oscars for Acting.<br/><br/>Between the Spectacular Special Effects and the Tearjerking score, Titanic will surely leave no dry eye in the house. A Classic will live on.</div>",Positive
382,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched the movie many many years ago when I was a teen. But I now say to myself, wow see, how a movie could be so that powerful that I could remember the movie all by my mind! Maybe because human being is learned that love is the best and true love is in stories and rare. and what is rare so is much more interesting for people. To me, it was beautiful to see a person could decide for herself. She could be different than all her families, could enjoy simple things.
The whole story is memorable, lovely, and classic!</div>",Positive
383,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""I don't even have a picture of him, but he lives in my heart forever.""</div>",Positive
384,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Four years and many notable awards (including Best Picture Oscar) after, and the all-time box office number one position, why did Titanic succeed?<br/><br/>Personally, it was magical. The recreated ship, the sinking, the digital effects, were all a beautiful backdrop to one thing - the love story. The love story was the fantastic notion that love has no limits, love crossed class barriers and it won our hearts in the end.<br/><br/>Even if ""true"" love like this doesn't really exist, it's nice to think that for three hours, here, at least it does.</div>",Positive
385,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfect in practically every way, and probably my favorite romance (aside from CASABLANCA (10/10)). the 3+ hour length did not bother me. The ship itself, of course, is gorgeous and the score is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio, who never had impressed me much before, was quite good, but not nearly as good as Kate Winslet, who I feel deserved the Best Actress Oscar (although I love Helen Hunt dearly). Victor Garber, who played the builder/designer of the Titanic, is excellent, although under-used and under-appreciated. Gloria Stuart is great in her supporting role, but not as good as the incredible Kathy Bates as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, my favorite character. The direction by James Cameron is incredible, especially during the actual sinking of the Titanic (which is incredibly moving and well done). Sure to be considered a classic for years and years to come.<br/><br/>10/10</div>",Positive
386,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one the best movies ever made. Although it does not compare to Gone With the Wind. It is still very entertaining. The special effects are excellent. The cast is the best. I just adore Kathy Bates. I love all her movies. Frances Fisher is also among my favorites.</div>",Positive
387,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw the film at 1997 when I was only 14 years old.Much advertisement such as ""the most money paid on the epic production""and""A touching love movie""was propagandized everywhere,that made me tantalizing to see it.As a result,I liked it very much and moved by it after appreciating the film as most people in the world. Maybe you think that I was only a boy then.To tell you the truth that 8 years later,I still think it an excellent film although somebody think it not.Maybe this love story looks not relative to our real life,but it won't conceal that the music,special effect and picture are outstanding even much better than the ones now.I have seen the film only once despite many people's several times and I still love it as one of my best favorite movies.</div>",Positive
388,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved Titanic a lot. I wasn't around when the Titanic actually sank. But this movie made me glad i wasn't around to see it. The artwork and the storyline really keeps you wanting more and more from this film. The acting was pretty good and the love couple of Jack and Rose definitely didn't make this movie boring because i wanted to see what would have happened in the end when the ship would have sank. Some very minors things with the movie was that the acting was a bit corny in a couple of areas, and the fact that they didn't go a bit more into detail with the characters but doesn't make it bad in anyway what so ever. Another impressive is that after 10 years people are still talking about how great this movie is, and for some reason you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!!!</div>",Positive
389,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Titanic is one of my favorite movies because it was based on a true story. This movie has a lot of drama, action, and suspense. I like the setting of this movie because it takes place in the early 1900's and the replica of the ship is very semilar to the one that really sank in the Atlantic ocean. This is a very sad movie, and it also breaks your heart how all those people die trying to save their lives. Jack and Rose are the main character; they fall in love when they meet in the ship and they go through a lot of problems to stay together, but at the end it is very sad to see him die and not be able to be with his loved one. My vote for this movie is a 9 because it is a very good movie. I believe that the producers and directors did a very excellent job with this movie.</div>",Positive
390,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.<br/><br/>Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.<br/><br/>The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!</div>",Positive
391,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, well what can I say that hasn't already been said. these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story!! How amazing! Leo and Kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet. In the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship. The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It's still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn't imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite! Leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and Kate is as well.</div>",Positive
392,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film...
plot, acting, &amp; visuals look great even though it was released in 90s..
audience would feel the scenes in the movie...
Thumps up!!</div>",Positive
393,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An astoundingly brilliant film that must be seen by all movie fans. Raised the bar significantly with a perfect combination of special effects and emotion thanks to great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Its easy to see that the 2 of them had a great on and off screen chemistry. The success of the film however is down to James Camerons meticulous direction and dedication, undoubtedly his best film. At a cost of 200m it was the most expensive film ever made when released in 1997. When watching the film I forget that the ship is mainly computer generated and the waves arn't real. I was swept along by the sheer spectacle of the film. Three hours of film that never leads the audience astray and has a final one and a half hours that is the most gripping of any epic I have ever seen. The most successful film of all time doing 1.8 billion at the box office world wide and winning 11 Oscars. It deserves all the success it has had and is a true masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, see it! p.s get the special edition DVD,preferably 5 disc</div>",Positive
394,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">TITANIC was a life changing experience for me, even as cliche' as it may sound.  I went to see the film just by chance.  I had not heard much about it at the time, and just went to see it because it was a new film that had just opened.  It forever changed my life.  I've now seen it 14 times in all, 12 a the theatre.  Each time I see the film it is as if I am really aboard the great ship, and I feel what the characters feel.  James Cameron has done a magnificent job of expressing the emotions and feeling of each character, and it never ceases to touch my soul.</div>",Positive
395,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was skeptical when I first went to see the movie with my wife. I had heard it was a ""chick-flick"", and that the director had incorporated fictional characters into the real life drama. I was pleasantly surprised when I left the theatre. The movie delivered a compelling and factual account of the disaster, intertwined with the fictional main characters. Jack and Rose were important to the movie. They really told the story of so many of the actual Titanic victims who remain unknown to this day.<br/><br/>Close to 1500 souls went down with the ship. The movie helped me to see their struggle to survive, and what were the shocking effects of hitting the iceberg. The tragedy at the World Trade Center certainly correlates with the Titanic disaster for modern times. This movie has piqued my interest so much that I viewed the Titanic exhibit when it came to Cleveland in 2002.</div>",Positive
396,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie could have become a real disaster. A love story between a rich girl and a poor boy - seen it a thousand times, and it always had a happy end. Not so in Cameron's film! The Titanic hits the iceberg - it could have been like watching a 50's sci-fi today. Again Cameron's Digital Domain (with Hollywoods most famous special-effects-factories on their side) created one of the most spectacular movies ever. Some movies get all these things right but still do a very messy job - eg. use plates with a ""made in Hong Kong"" sign on them. However, Cameron paid attention to the details. All in all, the actors were really good (and not only Leo and Kate, but Billy Zane and Co. as well!) and the breathtaking cinematography and music combined with Cameron's monumental style (T2, True Lies, The Abyss) gave a wonderful mix.</div>",Positive
397,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well-written, well-acted, and just an awesome movie is what I can say about Titanic. I didn't go to the movie on my B-Day in March, 1998 to see Leo. I went to see it because I was curious as to what all the hoopla was about. What I saw just took my breath away. It was absolutely incredible how one man can have such an impact on any film. And that man was James Cameron. There was such detail and such accuracy with the sinking of the ship (Including the blinking out of all the lights on board). The post-sinking just went through my bones like a cold chill. I couldn't believe it. People frozen to death, people in lifeboats still calling to see if anyone is still alive, and the final scene with Jack in it. Because of this film, I am studying as much of the Titanic as I can. This movie will remain a classic for years to come.</div>",Positive
398,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay, it was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen. I thought the plot was well done, I thought the special effects and the detail of everything was amazing, and I thought the movie did a phenomenal job of developing some other characters (i.e. the string quartet during the sinking) if only for their fifteen minutes of fame. Everything made it a full experience, and I felt it was worth the five bucks to see it. In fact, I went to see it a second time. The only weak part was that the ending took about two minutes too long, but that's a minor point.<br/><br/>It was a great movie, but please, the boat sank, get over it.</div>",Positive
399,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a stunning portrayal of the 1912 disaster that never gives up any of its emotional or nostalgic appeal.  The Titanic disaster was one of the icons of the gilded age, and this was the key element to this film.  The cast was excellent and the special effects were awesome as well--but none of it would have held up without this.<br/><br/>I cannot articulate accurately how much I love this movie.  If you're looking for a film that speaks to you emotionally and historically, watch Titanic.  You won't be disappointed!</div>",Positive
400,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved the film "" Titanic "" and it wasn't just for Leonardo Dicaprio's pretty face. It was for everything. For the pretty love story, for the story of Titanic, the ship that was unsinkable. The wealth, the poverty, the ignorance, the despair, the trust, the hope, the love... Great film of James Cameron with great interpretations so much of Leonardo Dicaprio as of Kate Winslet.</div>",Positive
401,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, what can I say? Titanic is just the best movie ever! It has it all! The acting is GREAT! Kate Winslet was stunning and beautiful. She deserved the Oscar for her role as Rose. I can`t wait to see her next movie Hideous Kinky. Leonardo also did a great job. The movie is Fantastic! If you didn`t see it in the cinema, go and see it on video now!</div>",Positive
402,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of those movies that will have to be rereleased in the theaters periodically, because you miss a lot on the small screen.  Even so, Cameron's fantastically detailed canvas still amazes me. The movie is filled with images you can never forget.  It's the work of a great visual artist.</div>",Positive
403,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The tide will turn yet again: in light of watching the overly-wrought ""Gone With the Wind,"" I say this...""Titanic"" saves great thrills for its viewers, inviting us to understand what it means to be saved...in every way that a person can be saved. It is a brilliant homage to silent era films, with classic moments of dire terror, and bravado scenes of self-sacrifice. Watching this amazing film has taught me more about what it means to experience the joys and sorrows life brings us all. And to live each moment in a fuller way.</div>",Positive
404,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yeah, the movie was something! I think it was the best one ever made. The beginning of Titanic is my favorite. When Jack won the tickets and everything else it was just wonderful. I also like the parts when Rose and Jack talked...also in the beginning. It was funny. The part when Titanic sank...well tht was the longest part...about 1.5 hours...I think it was a little too long. I don't know. I did not really cry at all, but i was really sad. The very end of the movie was good too. Did Rose die at the end? I am not sure. I guess we'll never know. The movie all together was just great. Looked very realistic. Good job, Cameron. I think if we would have more of those kinds of movies it would be so much fun. I really don't know what to say...it's hard to explain what I feel about it. You just have to see it. Oh well i guess everyone already did, but if you did not where have you been? Anyway i think it was a really good movie and I really recommend it. :)</div>",Positive
405,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect as Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson!  Billy Zane is also great as the villain Cal Hockley.<br/><br/>The musical score is very beautiful.   The action scenes are exciting. But, it's the romance that makes this film great!<br/><br/>Titanic stirs up emotions and touches one deeply. It's ""forbidden"" romance between star-crossed lovers during a cataclysmic event is reminiscent of Casablanca and Gone With the Wind!</div>",Positive
406,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies ever made!.... and also a movie people ONLY would put down because of the attention it got.... 'Titanic' is absolutly flawless... never boring... and has a story to die for... A powerhouse with the Oscars, only true lose (besides Kate) was Gloria Stuart being practically robbed of a VERY worthy her Best Suporting Actress Oscar.... Everything Is to like about this film from the Song (one which we all know) to the Actors, and lets not forget the special effects... they just dont get any better than that.... lets face it hardly any film gets better than this... except 'Gone With The Wind of coarse...   :)</div>",Positive
407,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wonderful!I have never seen better film than Titanic before.It was fantastic,it is fantastic and it will be fantastic.I think Leonardo was very good,and Kate was very good,too.And the film was unforgettable.</div>",Positive
408,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think people hate this film because they are letting the hype about the film interfere with how they see the film.  Don't judge a film based on outside influences.  Don't hate it because Cameron is an egomaniac.  Don't hate it because 14 year old girls went 20 times just to see Leo.  Don't hate it because they played that song 10 times a day for a year.  Hate it because you hate the movie itself, what was on the screen and that alone. If you but all the hype aside I think you will see a truly great film.  A film that succeeds on many levels.  Special effects, acting, music, action, humor, historical, moral, philosophical.  Did I miss one? I'll admit I love Cameron films.  I don't however typically like ""chick"" flicks, and this is partially a chick flick.  But it is also an ""action"" flick. Does it go on to long.  I say about 5 minutes.  I hate the part with the stupid kid screaming alone in the hallway.  Other than that it's perfect in just about every way.  I graduated from film school and nothing I saw there came close to this film.</div>",Positive
409,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thoroughly engaging.  Great set-ups/pay-offs and attention to detail.  Most characters possessed redeeming qualities.  One major character suffered an unresolved storyline.  Nice mixture of drama/romance/action.  The ""travelling angel"" motif is perfectly executed.  Special effects were first rate. Haunting score.  An instant classic.  Today was my third time watching it, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first.</div>",Positive
410,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is my favorite movie of all time and I will never get tired of it.  I love everything about it and would never change a thing.  I think the backlash is assanine and people should always go with their first opinions. I LOVE this movie and that will never change.</div>",Positive
411,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Titanic"" is an epic cinematic masterpiece, this is the type of movie that 50 years from now will be considered one of the all time best. ""Titanic"" is an epic in every sense of the word, watching the great ship sail and then sink is one of the great technical triumphs of film in the 1990's. The talented cast turns in solid performances and the direction from James Cameron is top notch. I can't really say much more about this film that hasn't already been said so sit back and enjoy.</div>",Positive
412,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is an epic, a true epic, and will continue to be loved forever. Many people did not like it because they do not understand the message epics are sending out: ""Morals put to life, dreams fulfilled in movies.""  Titanic fulfilled these and will continue to for generations.  ""Gone With the Wind"" was respected just as much as Titanic when it came out, and now many deem it to be the best movie the world has ever seen.  So go back and watch ""Titanic"" and remember the words I said as you view this epic spectacle masterpiece that has been made immortal by being named the title of ""Best Picture 1997"" and ""The No. 1 Movie in the World"".</div>",Positive
413,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is and will always be the best movie of all time. A flop would have ruined two studios, but the film became most successful film of all time. The characters are great, I enjoyed watching Kate Winslet and Leo Di Caprio a lot, because Leo wasn´t such a big star when the movie came out. After the success he got really arrogant, but that´s my opinion.<br/><br/>But the best work did James Cameron. I still can´t believe with what an unbelievable expenditure he let the Titanic sink, and in all this there´s always  the love Story with Jack and Rose, simply fantastic. One thing I´ve to say at last is that I enjoy the soundtrack too, James Horner couldn´t do a better work than this one. Nothing more to say I rate it 10/10<br/><br/>&gt;</div>",Positive
414,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film, saw it with a small audience in the theatre.  This allowed me to feel the moods of this picture, which translated to an exciting, terrifying and sad story.  It shows you how precious life and love are when you finally discover it. Amazing film making, so real and grand were the sets, the photography was remarkable.</div>",Positive
415,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is an excellent movie,with excellent graphics and acting. it was<br/><br/>very hard for me to watch it because i have an intense fear of drowning,<br/><br/>but i managed to get through the whole thing and then bought it on video<br/><br/>later. the costumes and furniture in this film are so beautiful, i love<br/><br/>the dresses that Rose wears. the ship itself is awesome! they did such a<br/><br/>good job on all the special effects in the movie, i was very<br/><br/>impressed.</div>",Positive
416,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of the best films ever made. it contains stunning performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. there are many scenes in this picture that make you want to cry, particularly the scene where Rose says she'll never let go of Jack forever. It is one of the most touching scenes in the history of American cinema and Titanic is truly a classic among classics. It ranks as James Cameron's best film to date and will continue to be one of my favorite films. The winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1997, Titanic truly ranks among classic films such as Gone with the Wind and The Godfather.</div>",Positive
417,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay, people that are criticizing Titanic about how James Cameron just decided to make a movie about one of the most historic events in time and add a love story to it.  I read an interview with James Cameron.  He wanted to make a movie about the Titianic and show how grand and sad it's story was.  The only way he could do this however was to have it as a romance movie, though it's not completely a romance movie.  So there you go. Stop making rude comments about it.  I am a huge Titanic fan (the ship) so I know a lot about it.  I think that the makers of this movie were pretty truthful to the ship.  People this is one of those rare movies where it has everything.  Action, humor, romance, its educational, and just great.  I really do enjoy watching this movie and according to the Academy Awards a whole lot of other people do also (even though not a lot of people enjoyed The English Patient).  But, this is a excellent movie.  Watch it!!!!!</div>",Positive
418,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There has never been a film that speaks to so many different age groups as Titanic.  A few bad lines of dialogue do not ruin this work of art.  The film can be viewed on three different levels.  There is the the (commercial) love story and the (formula) epic disaster.  Most viewers tend to deal with Cameron's masterwork from these perspectives.  But, there is a third, deeper level that is actually responsible for the film's wide appeal (it is a cynical myth that Titanic communicates only to teenage girls).  Titanic is, at bottom, a metaphorical telling of the workings of human emotional experience trapped in space yet set free through time.  I've written three detailed cyber essays on this wonderful film.  Please contact me if you're interested in reading more of my analysis.</div>",Positive
419,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best love story of all time... Timeless in all aspects and one of the most accurate movies Ive seen.... AAAAAAA+++++++++  a definate 10! Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio are both excellent and seem to be so accurate on their characters.. Anyone that loves romantic movies should see this!</div>",Positive
420,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Anyway, I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It had OUTSTANDING special effects, nice love story, OUTSTANDING score, nice song, good performances, FANTASTIC--yet somewhat predictable ending, and a naked Kate Winslet!!!!<br/><br/>3(***)out of 4(****)stars</div>",Positive
421,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are a lot of people out there that hate this movie and right off the back i want to say that this is one of the best movies ive ever seen. I will admit the love story was a little annoying and a waste of time (they had to waste the first 2 days some way) but i dont think anyone can disagree that the sinking of the ship was a amazing and horrifying thing to watch. The special effects were perfect at that part and James Cameron captured what happened perfectly. This movie deserved best picture. A-.</div>",Positive
422,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first thing I'll say about this movie is that it was excellent and will long be remembered as a classic for this generation. The casting was excellent with the possible exception of Leonardo DeCaprio - somehow he just seemed a bit young for the part. Chris O'Donnell or Josh Lucas would've been a bit closer to the mark here. As far as the Rose character, wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet, it didn't take a lot of time to see the possible real person she was based on. Her mannerisms and defiance of custom seemed to emulate the late Alice Roosevelt Longworth (1884-1980), daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. As I watched Kate, I began to see Alice, literally! If you don't know much about Alice and her later impact on Washington DC politics and mores, there are several great bios available. I would recommend this film to anyone over 13, parents should watch out of the eyes of the little ones. Excellent film!</div>",Positive
423,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I honestly believe that Titanic is the best movie ever made.its the story of a doomed ocean liner and the star-crossed lovers on board.The characters and casting are perfect. Especially Kate Winslet and Billy Zane. They both succeed in bringing their characters to life. The special effects are amazing in this movie and made me believe i was actually seeing the real ship sink. Also the music in this movie was very tasteful and tied in perfectly. I have seen it many times and still get emotional when watching it. It's hard to believe all the people who bash this movie. Just check which movie is number one all time in the U.S, International and world wide and Titanic is number one in all three categories. So its my opinion that most people love this movie but will not admit it.</div>",Positive
424,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Except for the unnecessary language and most of the sexual content, this was one of the best films I have ever seen. Leo's performance as Jack was somewhat over the top and cheesy, but that is to be expected considering that it's Leo DiCaprio. Kate Winslet's character really fit her. I have seen her performances in other films but none compare to this one: the rich girl who thinks she's seen it all until she meets the man from the other side of the tracks. Seeing her in this film was seeing yet another side of Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates is hilarious as Molly Brown and I would not have put her in any other role. The end of Titanic had me on the edge of my seat. You know what's going to happen, but you're just not sure how or when it's going to happen. All in all, this was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone.</div>",Positive
425,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is one of the best movies that i have seen out of all of my 13 years. This movie made me cry just by hearing the song...Me and my friends are such lunatics about this movie that i printed out quotes...and am looking for the script...and lemme tell ya' we all think that Leo makes a great jack...we all cried at the end...and some of us even cried at the beginning thats how much we love it...i mean it effected us so emotionally that two lovers were separated and that some people never got a chance...and like i said..we're only 13...but there love kept them together through the hardest times..and she never did let go...and when they reunited i literally burst into about a million tears...just goes to show how powerfully emotional that movie is</div>",Positive
426,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now although this film is underrated (PG-13) it should be (R) mainly because of Kate Winslet's ""big scene"". Now about that big scene, I seem to not be able to stop thinking about it, yet it's not like I'm going to repeatedly picture her like that okay, it's only this film and only this film that this happens oh, and only during that particular scene. Titanic is a fantastic film, both Leo Decaprio and Kate Winslet make a great pair here, and do a terrific job too. I think Kat Winslet deserves another award for bravest actor, she was strong in this film, and I would assume she was also very comfortable doing that big scene. She had to be, I mean she was totally clothes less, and by the camera angles a lot her was seen while she was ""that way"". Anyway, Kate was great, Leo was great, this movie was great. I give it a 10. Half for the film and half for Kate.</div>",Positive
427,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is an overall amazing movie! It even includes romance; in a movie about a disaster you would think romance wouldn't work so well but it really makes the movie spectacular. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio act with such passion that it makes the whole movie wonderful. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. The detail is amazing; the furniture, utensils, etc. is absolutely extraordinary. I definitely recommend Titanic. The soundtrack matches the movie so good and the feeling and passion in the movie makes it feel like you were there. The suspense comes in at all the right places and really contributes to the overall movie. It's amazing how the Titanic was recreated to look like the actual ship, it really does. The historical footage at the beginning of the movie and near the end really shows how bad the sinking was and how terrible it would have been to have to leave your loved ones on the sinking ship as you stepped into a life boat. Again I really recommend Titanic, it's an extraordinary movie!</div>",Positive
428,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I first saw Titanic, I was amazed at how well it was done. The acting was perfect, the directing excellent, and the story-line was also good. Every time my family and I (my mom and I) go to rent movies, I ALWAYS try to rent Titanic. I think it's the best movie I've seen (besides Chronicles of Narnia). My grandparents have never seen this movie. I told them that they should rent it and watch it, because it was a very good movie. It was good. There was lots of drama, which I like. There was also romance woven into the story-line, which I also liked. I think that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Rose (Kate Winslet) made great leading people in the movie. They worked well together, and I was surprised. That's the reason why I give Titanic 10 out of 10. The acting, directing, and story-line are excellent. If you haven't seen Titanic yet, I encourage you to rent it and watch it. It's a great movie! 10 out of 10 for Titanic.</div>",Positive
429,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron is always to impress...and that is why I'm going to say this film is his second best, terminator 2 being #1. It's a good story, great acting by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Professional Directing, just basically one of the best films ever. It deserves every bit of it's box office total. Even though i am a boy, i balled my eyes out at the end of this movie. It was a wonder to see in the movie theater, and is just as good with it's 3 disc, digitally enhanced DVD collection, which i own. So, if u have not seen this film, i HIGHLY advise you to do so. It takes all the elements of Sound, Picture, Acting, Directing, Editing all it it's highest, and creates a monumental film that should be FOREVER remembered. 20/10!</div>",Positive
430,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">the first time i saw it i cried my heart out. the film is a special and i knew it from the first time that i saw it. in the film you never know what will happen next, obviously you excpect that Jack and Rose will remain together but that is not what happens. sometimes directors try to do their film as people excpect it to end in a happy ending, but one must realise that in reality that is not what happens, at least not always. and i really like these types of films, actually i like all types of films. Leonardo Di Caprio is so cool and (in the film at least) he and Kate Winslet look perfect for each other.but one may never know.....</div>",Positive
431,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is indeed an excellent movie, and one that everyone should probably see at some point or another. It is truly a gem among films. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, easily some of the best that I have ever seen. The performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are some of the truest and most heartfelt ever. Their chemistry is perfect, totally and utterly believable. James Cameron does an awesome job directing. The suspense remains the entire time, even though you know how it's going to turn out. My only problem with Titanic is the length. Seriously, a good half hour - 45 minutes could have been cut from the end. Do we really need to see all of those people drown? Yes and no. No, because 3 hours and 14 minute is way to long, even for an epic movie. Yes, because it makes the entire thing more believable and all the more heart/gut wrenching. Titanic is an amazing movie, but not one that you can see a ton of times. The 1st time it's amazing, the 2nd time it's okay, the 3rd time you end up checking your watch ever 5 minutes waiting for it to be over. A solid 10/10.</div>",Positive
432,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe this movie has such a low score... a 7! Come on guys, it's a classic and it was brilliantly produced!<br/><br/>Let's not forget that it is the highest-grossing movie in history, as to date it has made $1.85 Billion!<br/><br/>To pick out ANY weak points, the main storyline regarding the romance of Rose &amp; Jack is perhaps a little cliché, but overall this movie is very good-if not excellent. The special effects,acting and stunts are all performed exceptionally.<br/><br/>This movie is so underrated, that I was shocked when I saw the 7 stars! I mean it's made more money than Stars Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Mission Impossible and anything remotely close.</div>",Positive
433,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What can I say that hasn't already been said about James Cameron's Titanic? Those of you who haven't heard of it must have been living under a rock these past ten years, seeing as it remains the highest grossing movie of all time and won a remarkable 11 Oscars...yes, including Best Picture. There are people who hate it---people who seem unconvinced that a film of such grand spectacle and infinite popularity could possibly own up to the hype...and then there are those who love it. And I am proud to say that I am among the admirers. Maybe it's because I'm a hopeless romantic, but there's an appeal to the movie---a sort of magic that captivates me every time I watch it. Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life, and while doing so, forget the mass popularity and view it as what it really is---a bittersweet, unforgettable love story.</div>",Positive
434,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie when it first came out, and I was just in first grade. It was so mind boggling. I had never seen special effects like it. And somehow, even when I was that little, I still understood the romance and Jack and Rose's love for each other. It's my favorite movie of all time, in my opinion it's my mother's Gone with the Wind or Wizard of Oz. I absolutely love it. I watched it for the first time with two of my friends after not seeing it for many years, and by the end of the movie we had used up 3 boxes of Kleenex. After seeing it again, I was disappointed to see the special effects after movies like Lord of the Rings. There were fog lines around the ship when it was sinking, the sky was very fake and you could tell the background was fake all throughout the movie. But the acting, the acting makes the movie. The love is the most believable love in any movie. You can tell that the story was a love that lasts for ever. Even though millions of people hate this movie, millions also are in love with it, and millions will cherish it forever, and it will go on in the ""Titanic lovers"" hearts no matter what a user vote says.</div>",Positive
435,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well! this film catched the hearts of million viewers all over the world. By the way, this film was released early in 1997, but i've watched this film late on 2000. What a late bloomer. Some people say's this is a great and very touching movies. So I tried to search a original copy of this film and luckily i found it. It's very touching you know. The story lines, sound effect and flow of the story. I've feel I was there in the unsinkable ship together with the other passenger when its sinking. What a masterfully done by James Cameron.<br/><br/>The actors are greats such as Leandro and Kate, they justified the role they played in the film. I cry in the scene that jack is dying in the freezing water, and rose try to wake up jack when she see the rescuer to catch them. I'll give 9 out of ten in this film. It was great.... ever...</div>",Positive
436,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic has to be one of the most amazing films I've seen, i think it is so good how we see rose and jack succeed in their relationship but as soon as it happens, the ship hits an iceberg and sinks, it seems like when rose is happy something bad happens, i love this film and it will always be a number one film for me ***** 5 star!!!<br/><br/>I also think the acting is amazing and i don't know how anyone can dislike titanic,<br/><br/>the film was perfection!!!!!<br/><br/>signed by<br/><br/>Summerflower</div>",Positive
437,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was only 7 the first time I saw Titanic, and the only thing I remembered, years later, was that Jack died in the end. But, little time ago, I found myself having (I don'y why) ""My heart will go on"" stuck in the head. It got me thinking about the movie and, as it was raining that day and that and I had it on tape at home, I decided to watch it. It's only then that I realized how an amazing movie it was. Despite the wonderful visual effects and the beautiful music, to me the most amazing part, that made it a worldwide success, was the storyline, the romance. All the actors were amazing and it was the first (and to this day only) movie to ever make me cry. Since I watched it, it is my favorite movie and all my friends who saw it have the same opinion.</div>",Positive
438,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is the most romantic movie i saw. And I know that all of you haters are thinking that the movie should have been about the titanic not about some romantic mushy stuff. but the titanic was filled with couples and the same thing that happened to rose and jack must have happened. i even read in a titanic book about an old couple and how the wife said the exact same thing that rose said when she didn't want to go on the boat without jack. And when you guys say that the movie was too long then you are wrong because when it ended i actually wanted to see more and was sad that the movie was over , and i know a lot of people agree with me on this just the same amount as the people who disagree with me.</div>",Positive
439,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">a movie that will stand the test of time! Winner of a big 11 Oscars and very well deserved. A gigantic blockbuster and also a modern masterpiece! the most expensive movie ever made as well the greatest film of the decade. an epic romance and a big action packed thrill ride. A rich girl meets and falls for a poor artist. Their love cannot be stopped but the luxury liner hits an iceberg and starts to sink... Featuring classic moments, amazing action and massive set pieces, an amazing cast featuring Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. A triumphant achievement and a movie to cherish forever. An unforgettable journey of cinema magic. The greatest epic tale ever!</div>",Positive
440,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The years past fast and I still remember when everyone talked about going to see the movie Titanic. I don't like to go to the movies so I didn't care much about it. However, as the weeks passed my interest on going to watch the movie increased. Finally, one day my family invited me to go see it, and I decided to go to the theater. The movie impressed me a lot, it was sincerely wonderful. I still remember the scene when Jack took Rose to the end of the ship, and she opened her arms, while a beautiful song played and the wind hit her hair. The fact that the romantic story developed from a historical event made the movie more interesting. The effects that portrayed the crash and sink of the Titanic ship were incredible. Finally, the end of the movie seemed as sad as it had to have been when thousands of people lost their lives when the ship sank in 1912. Good luck to James Cameron (Director), Leonardo DiCaprio (main actor), Kate Winslett (main actress) and all of those who made possible the production of this jewel of the cinematography world.</div>",Positive
441,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is an amazing movie, plain and simple. The acting is great, the visuals are incredible, it's all good, all of it. I have one nag about this movie. I have a hard time believing that Jack and Rose would be THAT much in love after only knowing each other for like, 3 days. Seriously? They've known each other for 3 days and their having sex. That really annoys me, but other than that, everything is brilliant. The first half of the movie is well acted by everybody, the cinematography is beautiful throughout, it's all great. The second half of the movie is utter brilliance beyond belief. I was almost crying watching that ship sink. James Cameron is a genius. Everything about this movie is awesome except the fact that Jack and Rose didn't know each other for more than 3 days. The writing was a little cliché and hokey, but all-in-all, this movie is beyond awesome, and is one of my favorites.</div>",Positive
442,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic never ceases to amaze The acting is incredible. The scenery breathtaking. The special effects, especially how Titanic fades into life from a hulking wreck. Nevertheless, it's a difficult film to watch with such catastrophic and tragic loss of life. Unlike Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams, I do not think that 3D really adds anything to the film. So much so, that I barely noticed it at all, except perhaps for the first few scenes. (Except, perhaps, that it got people into movie theatres a second time.) Only one scene in the film has been changed: the star field that Rose looks up at while floating on the driftwood has been altered to reflect the correct view for that date and time.</div>",Positive
443,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's a movie of real beauty, of real love and of the real hard life. Running over three hours Titanic became the most successful film of the history of cinema. Extravagant, inspiriting, astounding, poetic, romantic and totally unforgettable. Enormous emotive power. It's a terrific balance of realism and romanticism. Every time I watch it there are tears in my eyes. The story could not have been written better - the juxtaposition of rich and poor, the sorrow and the increasing fear in the eyes of everyone on the board, the hidden message that life is uncertain, you don't know what is ahead of you and you have to live every single moment while you are still here on that planet. With that masterpiece Mr. Cameron proved that he is the king of the cinema.</div>",Positive
444,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Magnificent epic in every sense of the word.Great acting, amazing visuals, legendary music.... One of the best films ever created in human history of cinema. The love story is heartfelt and the chemistry between Leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet is smouldering and magical.A must watch</div>",Positive
445,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The appeal of this movie is, although have seen more than once, the plot to chat at heart, the 3 d remakes release when everyone is looking forward to go to the, full of people, and then was shocked again.For rose and jack, the ship that is the most beautiful of the most wonderful life for a few days a few days, rose also used to mark his life.</div>",Positive
446,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When Rose, an elderly woman, dreams back at midnight, a long lens passes through the lobby and shakes up the stairs. Jack, who is standing in front of the clock, turns around. He is vigorous and charming, just like yesterday.</div>",Positive
447,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its a true story but one of my favourite love films. I can watch this over and over. It breaks your heart!!</div>",Positive
448,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The death of the captain and the designer moved me to tears. I know from this movie that the captain lives and dies with the ship. Leonardo and winslet are always two of my favorite actors.</div>",Positive

450,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a film that has everything. From the undying love between Rose and Jack, to the devastating historical reenactment of the tragedy that overcame the Titanic on its voyage, it has it all. The romance of these star-crossed lovers cannot help but touch the hearts of all who watch. James Cameron did a fantastic job on this masterpiece. The costumes were beautiful. The acting took you back in time to the beginning of the 20th century. I urge anyone who likes films in any way to see this heart touching piece. It is stirring to the soul. So unplug the phone, put in the movie, curl up on the couch and prepare to be amazed. This is a motion picture not to be missed!</div>",Positive
451,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The perfect disaster movie. Just think about all those movies that have great effects and then try and through in a love story. Then think of Titanic, which is first and for most a love story, surrounded by amazing effects. Sure the movie isn't perfect, the dialogue could have been a little better. The movie starts a little slow, but then at some point you are drawn in and the characters become real, and the terror they face becomes real. By the end, when Rose dies and meets Jack on the staircase and everyone cheers it is impossible not to feel sad. This movie could had been horrible but it pulls it off. It was a real risk to make and it worked wonderfully. The reason this movie works is hard to describe. Maybe it's the slow beginning that does it. We start to forget that this ship is destine to sink and just watch what is on screen. Then when they finally do hit the ice berg the viewer feels that this is an interesting plot turn rather than the payoff the movie has been building to.</div>",Positive
452,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James definately hit the mark on this. To me the love story, which is superb, takes a backseat to the chaos and variety of ways people would have behaved in it.</div>",Positive
453,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing movie..cant believe i watched it 30 times since 1999</div>",Positive
454,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this film twice in a week at the theatre, there was just too much beauty and detail on the ship to absorb in one one sitting.<br/><br/>Despite its overall running time your attention is maintained (for the most part)partly because the film is split between present and past times.<br/><br/>There are just one or two moments however, that seem over long.<br/><br/>On the whole it tells the sad story in a novel way with a fine and haunting score.<br/><br/>Enjoy it</div>",Positive
455,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">for this movie to have made over 1.2 BILLION dollars worldwide!<br/><br/>Bash it or trash it but it was what we go to movies for...well most of us! Romance and LOVE!<br/><br/>The fact that packs of girls and women went to see the movie time after time simply because it showed a love beyond compare at the tender young age in our lives, either means many of us are lacking that kind of love or we have never been in love and wish we were!<br/><br/>1.2 Billion...enough reason to make it the most watched movie ever!<br/><br/>Go suck an egg all you bashers!</div>",Positive
456,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is truly an amazing movie. They say you either love it or hate it. How can anyone hate this movie? Usually guys say they hate it because they do not like romance stories. These are the people that think explosions make a movie and romance is for girls only. I beg to differ. Who wrote this movie? A male. <br/><br/>Okay, so presumably the number 1 reason for disliking this movie is the romance. That is diminished by me, so is there any other reasons to hate it? NO! If anyone can say anything that's bad about this movie, try to, because you will be wrong. And I can defend that statement.<br/><br/>There's nothing more that needs to be said about a movie that's this amazing.</div>",Positive
457,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is the best 3D movie ever and also the best True Story movie ever it was just a outstanding movie that everyone will enjoy i like this movie a lot and i think you will like it to in 3D if you liked it before than you will like it even more in 3D this movie is OK for the kids it is the best Drama movie and the best movie ever created i hunk that when you see the Titanic in 3D you will say wow that was the coolest 3D movie i have ever seen that is how good this movie is i was about to cry in this movie this movie is a winner this movie is 100 percent the best movie ever oh when you go see this movie in theaters you may want to get a large popcorn because this movie is 3 hours 14 minutes long but besides that it was a wonderful movie this is a must see movie for everyone i give it two thumbs up for sure it is worth seeing you have to watch this masterpiece this is a movie that is going to be hard to get in 3D you just have to go see this movie in 3D have a great day</div>",Positive
458,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a normal love story with a bit action. I personally think it is way to over hyped. I bet it is because it is based on a real story. Everyone loves it and they say that it is such a beautiful movie but I honestly don't think so. I mean it is okay but it really does not deserve the hype it got now. When it came out maybe, okay I give it that. <br/><br/>But not now. It just got boring because you know what happens even before you ever saw it, you just know it because you have to.<br/><br/>But it got the girls on it's side, I'll give it that. When can live thru a boring movie for a girl, do it.</div>",Positive
459,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a big fan of the movie I'd like to clear up some misconceptions.  First of all, as someone who has seen this film many times at the theaters, the notion that teenage girls were responsible for making Titanic the huge success it was because of their obsession with Leonardo is completely wrong. In fact, they were probably in the minority in the audience.  What I saw was an older group of people coming to see this movie--probably at the urging of one of their grown children. In addition, I witnessed substantial representation of our city's  oriental community at most the showings. Obviously, this movie transcended age and ethic barriers; that's what made it the success it was! Was the dialog corny in some places?  Of course it was, just like in real life romances! Could they have developed the characters more?  Yes, but the movie is already over 3 hrs long, how much development do you want? Finally, this movie was very costly to make, and some say it was a waste of resources.  Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say--it'll remain the top grossing film for many, many years.</div>",Positive
460,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has got to be the best movie of all time anyone who doesn't think so should regret it. This movie has it all action,violence,drama, tragedy,and of course comedy. This movie is really a movie to remember. Years from now people will still be talking about this fantastic movie with a mix of fantastic actors/actresses. Including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet,Kathy Bates,Billy Zane,Gloria Stuart,and Victor Garber. Those were just a few of the many outstanding actors of TITANIC. This movie has led me to my hobby and huge interest of TITANIC. I have a ton of books on the TITANIC,All the movies of TITANIC,stuffed animals, models of TITANIC, and many other things. I have also seen both the exhibit of TITANIC at the local Imax theater and the Ghosts of the Abyss. Which are both equally excellent. I'm going to close this by saying If you haven't seen TITANIC, YOU MUST!!!!!!!!!! AS YOU PROBABLY TELL I AM OBSESSED WITH TITANIC, and proud of it too.</div>",Positive
461,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is the only one that I have ever seen that made me want to go back and watch it again and again. There were so many things happening in this movie that you could not catch them all the first time you watch it. If this would have come out before the AFI'S 100 YEARS 100 MOVIES were anounced, it would have been in the top 10 of that list.</div>",Positive
462,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Personally,I don't buy this crap about the bad dialogues;this film is supposed to be realistic,right?Well,don't tell me that two people in love don't say a lot of inappropriate,unspectacular,stupid things to each other,especially in such a situation!...</div>",Positive
463,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie and leonardo did GREAT!... i give this movie a 10!..i love leonardo's movies..when he played romeo! Ah!..<br/><br/>HE really did great and to say its a true story. i really enjoyed this movie. peace, Amy</div>",Positive
464,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is the best film I've ever seen. Titanic was one of the first real films I ever saw (that excludes animations. I was 12 then and everybody where crazy about the film. That is my friends at school. We didn't do anything else but played Titanic at during brakes. <br/><br/>Of course I didn't appreciate the film as much then as now. I like it because I'm fascinated by Titanic (or well I became that after having seen the film). The accident was so sad. Those who have made the Titanic film really have managed to capture it. How could they make it look so real on film? That's what makes the film so good apart from the story that really appeals to me. Jack and Rose are great characters played very well in my opinion.<br/><br/>The conclusion is that Titanic is a film I can see over and over again. Actually I'm trying to buy it cheap on DVD on the moment!</div>",Positive
465,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of the most epic films of all time this 1997 tale is about the maiden voyage of the most popular ship in history the Rms Titanic. The film opens up with a under water discovery of the ill fated ship, it sank over 84 years ago and now Brock Lovett (Paxton is discovering old artifacts. He comes across a picture of a young woman lying naked on a couch and is soon contacted by Rose Dewitt Bukater Calvert (Stuart) she was the girl in that picture and soon Rose tells him and his crew her story about what happened in the days before the sinking. Kate Winslet is beautiful as Rose Dewitt Bukater and Leonardo Dicaprio is adventurous as Jack Dawson. This film deals with the romance between the two characters and the tragedy that occurs. Titanic is both romantic and sad better get out the tissues girls this is a must see movie. 10/10</div>",Positive
466,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This really is cinema at its finest. Titanic is a brilliant movie, mixing romance and tragedy together to tell a beautiful and fragile love story. The genius of the movie comes not from the tragic sinking of the liner but the romance that develops between Jack and Rose.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the 3 hr plus running time, this film canters along at breathtaking pace, with the final hour of the film containing some superb special effects.<br/><br/>Costing upwards of 200 million dollars to make, Titanic was all set to become one of the greatest flops of all time. Instead it has become an instant classic, a film that can be seen over and over again. Love, as they say, is eternal.</div>",Positive
467,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">TITANIC is great combination of romance ,drama and comedy .it won eleven academy awards. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet lighted up the screen as the young lovers (the poor artist Jack Dawson and the first class girl Rose)their journey becomes struggle to survive after the ship hits into an ice burg with no enough life boats.<br/><br/>James Horner creates the best music ever .the production is perfect . Cameron deserves all the respect for writing , producing and directing the movie.<br/><br/>the bottom-line,it is the best entertaining and dramatic movie you will ever see. do your self a favor and watch it ...</div>",Positive
468,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well nothing much as a review that i could write about the movie, as i was too small too watch it the first time it released in 1997. When I first saw this movie, I was aboard a Cruise liner in Asia pacific with my friends and fell in love with it completely. I must say that we did try all the stunts in the movie on the cruise as well. ;) When the movie released in 3D, I could not give it a miss at all. The drama and the story grips you completely when you watch it in a theatre. You get sucked into the movie right from the scene when older rose starts with her story of titanic. The sound and scenes makes the movie a memorable one. no wonder it won 11 Oscars.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Cameron for the wonderful experience in 3D.</div>",Positive
469,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">the contemporary storyline involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals she's the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiancé Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch, Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack, and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film, the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed, Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent..</div>",Positive
470,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story is so romantic! I can't stop crying during watching the movie. it's so moving. The love is so beautiful. Wish everyone have such a wonderful love story. Gonna watch this movie agian during the quarantine time.</div>",Positive
471,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Love this movie and the love story involved between jack and rose. though it takes a while to get the movie started when jack and rose finally meet the movie keeps getting better and better</div>",Positive
472,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron tell us a beautiful love story, maybe one of the greatest love stories in cinema history. I can easily say that, Titanic can be on my list of the 10 best movies I have ever watched. I don't remember that i was cried like that in a movie. We also must talk about Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. The chemistry between them is great. Both of them are legends.<br/><br/>Titanic is a timeless masterpiece, about a great love, in the middle of disaster...</div>",Positive
473,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">From the first time I watched this movie, I knew it was always gonna be one of my favorites.
From the beautiful direction and camera work and the music of choice to the amazing acting performed by Leo and Kate. It was a perfect choice to tell this story from a new but strong romance and love, giving the viewer a realization of how this must have been. When I watch this I feel happy, free and empowered but then scared for my own life just watching. It really gives you a picture of what it could have been like on the actual Titanic. This is art.</div>",Positive
474,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic not only depicted the actual events of the sinking, james cameron also added an emotional love story that touched our hearts. It made the people more real, and we could actually feel the horror and sadness that the real passengers may have felt.This movie was sad, touching and even a little funny. I would recommend this for anyone to watch. Is was EXCELLENT!</div>",Positive
475,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It will be another 25 years before a picture like this connects so well with the masses.  The last film to do so was the immensely popular Dr. Zhivago. Just like Zhivago this film has seemed to fade away as time has passed. Gone, but not forgotten as director after director attempts to recreate James Camerons masterful film.  If you didn't like the love story, the special effects amazed you.  If you didn't like the length, the sets and waredrobes amazed you.  There so much well done about this film that you couldn't possibly find something worth admiring.  The only film to come close to achieving pure entertainment is the Empire Strikes Back.</div>",Positive
476,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My favorite film of 1997 and perhaps among my all-time greats. It's a tad too long, but has two good elements: Love story and History. It is the finest Titanic recreation film ever, as it should be with a $280 million budget. I really enjoyed the budding love between DiCaprio and Winslet, the whole disaster thing, and the sadness of it all. I found this film has the most depressing scenes ever: A grand ship sinking forever, many people freezing in the water, Jack giving young Rose a sad pep talk, Rose letting go of Jack, seeing all the floating corpses, Old Rose in bed surrounded by her beloved pictures, and the final meeting with her lover Jack and all the Titanic passengers in the final dream-like sequence. <br/><br/>Winner of 11 Academy Awards and a definite tear-jerker that should appeal to female viewers.</div>",Positive
477,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I find it hard to relate to those of you out there who hate this movie.  Bad acting?!  Terrible dialogue?!  Well, we're all entitled to our opinions I suppose, but for me, this film is a wonderful experience!  It's there to be enjoyed, hate it if you must, but you're the ones missing out.<br/><br/>Is it perfect?  No, its a bit tricky to make a perfect movie, but if you're so fussy that you're looking for all the errors in a film, that you can't ignore them, then again, that's your problem.  Personally, I loved it, I'll forgive the few, and what I consider to be minor errors, and look forward to owning it :)</div>",Positive
478,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The first time AND the second time. I'm not one that usually enjoys romance in a movie, but this was different. The acting, cinematography, writing, special effects, everything was excellent. James Cameron deserves every penny he made from this film and the film deserves every Oscar it won. LA Confidential can't hold a candle to Titanic. It's like comparing the Mona Lisa to an 'Elvis on Velvet'.<br/><br/>I can't believe some of the people with their negative comments about this film but I guess if some people can believe OJ and Bin Laden are innocent, anything's possible.</div>",Positive
479,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The TOP GROSSING movie of all times and 11 academy awards winner.What else can you say about this movie except that at that time there were many people that watched it 3 times a day.So if you haven't seen this movie make your own decisions should you watch it or not.I would say that it is one of the best movies.All you people out there saying that this is terrible, put your minds together and do something better than James Cameron did in this movie. Probably deserves all its success.</div>",Positive
480,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many might disagree with me. But I can compare Titanic with Gone with the Wind in terms of their being great movies. Both are love story movies, and both are fractions of two of the most popular historical events.  Gone with the Wind depicts the horror of war, Titanic the horror of a sea disaster, all caused by human lapses. Titanic  is technically flawless, so with Gone with the Wind.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind has already endured the test of time. a classical movie, Titanic will still prove its worth, but surely it will.<br/><br/>My point, we should encourage and promote movies like these.</div>",Positive
481,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">say what you want about titanic ..it's made over a billion dollars worldwide and still continues to grow.it's becoming a classic like gone with the wind still is .. the acting may not have been a 10 but come on in the 90's there haven't been very many critical movies unless you like watching boring independent films or limited boring release films like mrs brown or elizabeth or shakespeare in love ..people like to see action ,romance and thrills .critical acclaim is fine and titanic deserves critical acclaim it was a hell of a movie.i loved it and always will.</div>",Positive
482,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">All the people who hate ""Titanic"" either must've missed it in the theatres or just hate Leonardo DiCaprio. Sure, he's over-hyped, but people forget how much of an awesome actor he is, see any of his older movies (esp. ""Basketball Diaries"" or ""Gilbert Grape"") to see how amazing of an actor he is. He does an awesome job in this movie, though I more imagined Christian Bale in his part. Gloria Stuart, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane are fantastic as well. Seeing this in theatres was the best theatre experience since ""Star Wars."" I even saw the movie 3 times. On video however, it lacks the oomph that the theatre left you, but it still looks and sounds incredible (get the Widescreen version). Director James Cameron perfectly caught the Titanic wreck and this is one of the most visually stunning and captivating films I've ever seen. Sure, some of the dialogue is weak, but who cares. This film impressed me and I'll never forget it. I still watch this movie from time to time.</div>",Positive
483,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you take away the special effects from this movie, you still have the greatest film ever made.  Usually, with big budget eyeball movies, nothing much is top notch outside of the special effects.  But personally, from the moment that Rose Dewitt-Bukater steps out of her car, she captivates all eyes in the audience.  She is the movie star of her time, and she was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar.  All of the other actors around her shine also, including Billy Zane, who is an amazing villain, Frances Fisher, Leonardo DiCaprio, and all of the other wonderful actors in this film, give the greatest performances for a film full of love, passion, and heartache.  This is the only flawless film I have ever seen.  I was unable to move from my seat after this journey, and that doesn't happen often. Titanic is a 10, Kate Winslet is a star, and the movie has won my heart.</div>",Positive
484,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie portrays how a society based on money = power really function in sticky situation. It gives a fair picture of how unfair this system can work. Along with being a realistic and believable movie, James Cameron manages to hold the audience's attention by evolving the movie and the historic happenings around the beautiful love story that occurs between Rose and Jack. Although the ending might seem unfair (I think I cried my heart out), the moral is that unless you are willing to let go of ""the safe solution"" in life you will never be able to gain something better. She did.  A wonderful movie that will make you laugh, boil with anger, cry, shake your head - you name it. It is absolutely a ""must-see"" movie, that surely will make you think. 10/10 stars! Enjoy!!! (make sure you are in a situation where you can cry, and don't have to worry about your mascara running - that will just spoil part of the joy of seeing it!)</div>",Positive
485,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love romances.  ""Lovie dovie"" movies are my favorite and although this movie was not perfect by far, it showed true romance.  It does seem to me though that there should have been perhaps a little more emphasis on the sinking of the ship rather than the romance of Jack and Rose.  As much as I like the romance part, I am also interested in historical events too.</div>",Positive
486,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think it is the best movie ever... I saw it 4 times in the cinema. The actors/actresses did a perfect job. You hate Hockley and Lovejoy You hate Rose`s mother for being so shallow You feel for Jack and Rose, and I cried the first 3 times at the end of the movie. I have read books about the catastrophe, and I must say that Cameron has done a perfect job.<br/><br/>Well ""Star Wars"" Episode 1, might be the most developed movie ever but ""Titanic"" just has more feeling.</div>",Positive
487,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is simply the best movie ever, and it will stay that way forever. All you hear about is the incredible special effects of the movie(which I admit are great) However, what makes Titanic so memorable is the engaging love story.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career as an enthusiastic, unselfish bum who saves a young woman(Kate Winslet) from leading a shallow, predictable life.  I am sick and tired of people ripping DiCaprio's performance because he was simply perfect for the role.  I am hardpressed to find another actor that could exhibit the freshness and excitement of DiCaprio.  Kate Winslet was incredibly believable as a spoiled, rich brat who wants to lead a more exciting life.  The movie also had light touches of humour which helped to balance its serious nature. All in all, a wonderful movie.  Kudos to James Cameron!</div>",Positive
488,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It takes a decade or so before narrow-minded people see beyond the hype and enjoy a movie for what it is.  Titanic and other mega-hits may have made tons of cash, but this fact should not persuade or dissuade anyone from enjoying the movie.  Just remember, Titanic was not hyped up like The Phantom Menace was.  Titanic's success was due almost entirely to being a good movie, and appealing to a very wide audience range.  If you want to hate a movie for being it's marketing, hate Phantom Menace or Blair Witch. Cameron has been my favorite director since Aliens, and this movie made him a household name, as he deserves.  I can't stress it enough: be objective, judge a movie on the movie, not on it's marketing.  Just remember, other directors sell themselves out and spend more time marketing their movies than making them (Lucas and Spielberg).  Cameron has never done this.  He may be a jerk, but he has integrity and simply loves to make movies, as Titanic shows.  He doesn't care how much money they make.</div>",Positive
489,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This along with Schindler's List is the greatest movie that I've seen, even though it's very different from Schindler's List, Titanic has all elements together: romance, drama, suspense acting and stunning special effects, no wonder it won 11 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>It's not coincidence that millions of people went to watch it over and over again.  10/10</div>",Positive
490,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I may be a guy, but this movie really hit me in the heart. I'm not the kind of guy that likes to pick a fight like every other man does, I got emotions, too. The first time I saw ""Titanic"", it seemed to pass by really fast. Sure, I admit, it's a long movie, but it felt like a ten minute cartoon. Before I knew it, it was over. What I'm trying to say is: Don't pass this one up. If you look into this movie very closely, you will see what I mean. I'm surprised ""Titanic"" isn't in the top 250 movies.</div>",Positive
491,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Every time a film becomes such a huge participant of pop culture in this country, the backlash will surly soon follow. People can trash it all they want - this film was successful on all levels. AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT! Cameron has smartly avoided the spotlight the last few years, not involving himself in any major feature film. Have the feeling he knows his critics can't wait to tear him down? And by the way, I agree the love story is relatively weak. But the film DOES justly honor the memories of those who died in this tragedy. Want an accurate depiction of what happened to some of the real people who were aboard, read the book ""A Night To Remember.""</div>",Positive
492,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought Titanic was a great movie one of the best I've seen in my whole life. It has great special effects, great acting, and it also has action and suspense, and it has some comedy and a lot of romance. This movie is way better than Armageddon, and I don't understand why so many people like Armageddon better.</div>",Positive
493,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, Titanic is a rather simple film in terms of storyline and character depth.  It is cliched and predictable.  But even with this, Titanic is simply one of the most entertaining and engrossing fairy tales of all time. It is truly one of Hollywood's greatest guilty pleasures.  Those who negatively criticize it do so simply because the film is popular.   A lot of wannabe  movie experts tend to look down upon it because it is their sophomoric opinion that anything popular or mainstream is simply not as good as the less popular art house or independent films.  As much as I love these small independent films, I still believe that Titanic has a special quality to it which gives it an almost magical essence.  It's hard not to like this film, assuming you can put all your jaded and cynical views aside.   A film like this comes along once every blue moon, and millions of movie goers around the world did well to make it into one of the most popular films of all time.</div>",Positive
494,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Some people today, especially guys, pretend they don't like Titanic, but they must be lying, for Titanic is a classic. I cry every time I watch it. The actors eloquently portray the bravery, fear, and other emotions that went on that dreadful night.</div>",Positive
495,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a fantastic Epic of a movie. The Drama, romance and that ship. This movie is the ultimate tier jerker. Every one I know has seen it and regardless if it was a male of female, all admitted to shedding a few to this movie. The score for the movie which is composed by James Honer is so haunting it's makes the hairs on my neck stand up.<br/><br/> Titanic is truly the greatest film of all time and deserves that no 1 spot.</div>",Positive
496,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the movie of the 90's.I cried as Jack hung on in the freezing waters of the Atlantic. How can you honestly say that this does'nt bring one tear to your eye?The forbidden romance of Jack and Rose got our hearts pumping, we danced along to the lower class fun.The title explains it all: It broke titanic barriers, brought in titanic crowds, and got titanic nominations, all in 1 week.It cost a titanic fortune, also.It was the forgotten era, and the movie shed some light to the 20's.</div>",Positive
497,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film Is the best film I've ever seen. It deserved the 11-Academy awards and the 1.8 billion dollars it earned world wide. It is so sad yet so beautiful. James Horner's score is a masterpiece. James Cameron showed us that the heart can go on after losing someone we love.Jack and Rose(DiCaprio,Winslet)Are two great film characters that will go down in movie history. THIS FILM IS UP THERE WITH ""GONE WITH THE WIND"".IT WAS TRULY A MOVING EXPERIENCE!!!!!! 10/10</div>",Positive
498,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this again recently on DVD.  This is a wonderful film.  I had heard some idiot say, ""the boat didn't sink fast enough"" and all of that.  Some people are so negative.  I love this movie.  It's magical and wonderful and romantic and the score is my all time favorite.  When the ship goes from wreck at the bottom of the sea and transforms back in time and becomes new again my heart was in my mouth.  A spectacular film from a great director.<br/><br/>Emma</div>",Positive
499,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well done.  I consider this a perfect film.  Finally a film that effectively gives something to everyone.  A romance film for the romantics;a horror film for fright fans;a disaster film;a great effects film for science fiction fans;and an action film with an independent film feel made for all demographics.</div>",Positive
500,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think this was an excellent movie and I have seen it many times. Every time you see it you don't get bored and you see it with more interest. All the charters have been beautifully and artistically presented. The movie gives you a picture of the fateful ship that was unsinkable but finally sunk in its first ever journey.</div>",Positive
501,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am writing this cause the comment that I read said it was the worst movie and how bad it was. Now I admit it is a chic flick in some ways, but in NO way is this a bad film. It IS a work of Art by James Cameron, just an absolute thrilling story line, and the graphics, man, the graphics are some of the best work ever done on a film. I don't believe this movie or story can ever be out done and should never be re-done. This is a passionate, moving, yet visually breathtaking piece of work. Leonardo DiCaprio no doubt has his best performance of his life, and Kate Winslet, whew, just as sexy as can be, plays a very emotional role as Rose. Jack and Rose fall in love as all of us wish we could. But as we all know it comes to a tragic end as the titanic meets the floor of the Northern Atlantic Ocean. There is only about 2 or 3 other movies that can even stand in the same realm as Titanic. If you haven't seen, this is A MUST SEE for all people. This movie really floated my boat. (get it) ;-) -Jason Lantz</div>",Positive
502,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Obviously the ship was traveling too fast to break the record for arriving in New York. The watchmen did not see the iceberg in time because they were not paying attention. It was absolutely disgraceful that most of the life boats left with only a fraction of the number of people they were designed to carry. I was disgusted at the men who forced themselves on the boats ahead of children and babies to save themselves. The scene I just broke down and cried in was when Rose was floating on the wooden door and after Jack had been saying ""never give up"" she heard the boat coming back looking for survivors. She excitedly repeatedly said to Jack the boat was coming but he had died.</div>",Positive
503,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Personally, it makes me sick to hear people say that they didn't like ""Titanic"" or that they don't care for it because it was a spectacular film. I felt as though I was one of the poor (yet lucky) people who sailed on this glorious ship that faithful night. I was scarred (in a good way) by this film and it is now a part of me. And for the past six years I have thought of nothing but Titanic. Yet, when I watched it again, I realized I didn't even see part of the glory. This is my FAVORITE film ever and I have seen most of the movies out there. That reader was correct: Open your heart up to Titanic and you will not be disappointed.</div>",Positive
504,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Greatest Film of The Twentieth Century Titanic is without a doubt the most moving and artist film of my lifetime. Titanic closes off the end of the century with an ode to the age. A disaster to end all disasters, a love story to last all the ages and a film that will be better appreciated for its perfection in decades to come. The movie that has achieved the most Oscar nominations (14, and All About Eve) and has won the most Oscars (only rivaled to Ben-Hur and The Lord Of The Rings in Oscars). The most popular film all-time in Box Office terms, and the most Expensive film ever made. Testimate to its glory.<br/><br/>Ode To Titanic</div>",Positive
505,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I haven't watched ""Titanic"" since I was little and growing up I constantly heard people harshly criticize this movie. So as a young teenager I made fun of it too. I recently watched it and I changed my mind. I have never cried at the end of the movie...not even ""The Notebook"" made me cry. At the end of ""Titanic"" my eyes were red , a box of tissues was empty , and tears were rolling down my face. When Jack dies at the end and she lets go of his hands...thats when I completely lost it. I heard that the part of Jack was almost given to Matthew McConaughey , and I'm sorry but I am glad the part was given to Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't care how much any one makes fun of me..I will always like him!! This movie will definitely withstand the test of time.</div>",Positive
506,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow in 1998 i was in grade too and didn't understand how good this movie was, i saw it in the movies and all i could think off is how boring this movie was until it got to the bit when the ship went down then i was hiding behind the chairs being scared as s**t. Now i look back and wish i had watched it properly in the movies because when i watch it now it brings me to tears, not a lot of movies can do that too me i have only cried in The Notebook, My Girl and the lion king.Its not just the death scenes that get to me its the romance how to people that just meet can end up soul mates, they would die for each other. Kate Winslet plays Rose so well, and well we all know Leonardo was made for acting you can see it in ""whats eating gilbert grape"" &amp; ""Basketballer Dairys"" they make this movie so enjoyable and wonderful to watch. People think this movie goes for too long, well how can it not go for as long as it goes for its got so much history, romance &amp; suspense to put in, it is excellent and it deserves a 10/10</div>",Positive
507,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this is the best movie ever! i cried, i laughed, i was shocked, i was sad, it was the perfect movie ever! i love this movie and the thing that i loved the most is the song. i think that song is like, the best song ever. i don't know if this movie got an Oscar, but if it didn't, it should. my friends and i are always playing around copying that part of titanic where she leaves her hand print on the fog in the car. that was my favorite part. i love this movie, and if u haven't seen it yet you really should because it made me realize something. love is not always gonna be there so cherish it. if it wasn't for this movie i don't' think i would be going out with my boyfriend right now. i love this movie so much. no joke!</div>",Positive
508,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is super great, but kinda suggestive...laugh out loud, it's a tear-jerker definitely, I mean to think that all of those people died, god! Leonardo, of course, is hot hot hot! I visited the Titanic Exhibit in Orlando and that completed the experience that the movie brings you. Being a girl, I cried through pretty much ALL of this movie. I wish that every girl could find a guy like Leonardo (in this movie at least) that would love them as much as he loved that girl. I can't really say anything bad about this movie because it's just too, too, too great. If you haven't seen it, which is unlikely, then go to Blockbuster right now! This is one of those classic movies you'll never ever forget.</div>",Positive
509,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film won 11 Oscars, was on everybody's favourite film's list and was cast with some of the most talented actors of it's time (probably ever for these particular roles). However, now it seems that people are embarrassed to admit how great Titanic really is, for the simple reason really, that people made it famous. Many people now wish to disclaim the performances (particually that of Leonardo DiCaprio) just because after the film came out they became world-wide heartthrobs, and the fact that they delivered truly memorable performances is thrown aside. I love this film and am proud to admit it. It's an excellent film that, no matter who disagrees, will live forever and go down in history as one of the greatest ever made!</div>",Positive
510,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic movie was directed by James Cameron is a true life story. I love this movie because of the tragic nature of the ship wreck which attracts some emotional feelings from the viewers. Titanic movie is personal and somehow pathetic in nature.<br/><br/>Brock Lovett is a ruthless treasure hunter in search of a diamond neck less believed to have been submerged under the sea in a titanic liner titanic. He was rest assured when his crew retrieved a safe bearing a sketch of a beautiful woman wearing the diamond. The story became more inviting when an old lady by name Rose Dawson came forward to make claims of the drawing on watching it on a TV program. The historic event of the proof of ownership of the diamond by the lady in question may not be re-counted here However it is pertinent to note that Rose (the claimer) joined the Titanic at a young age Of seventeen when she was lured into a false marriage with a wealthy American by her mom, which almost landed her in a tragic end.</div>",Positive
511,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">On a recent viewing of Titanic, I realized that some of the Special Effects now look slightly dodgy. Still, the bulk of the film holds up very well. The beginning is a bit slow as the older Rose narrates her story. Bill Paxton is wasted in a thankless part. Leo and Kate's tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though. They absolutely convinced me they were in love. Once the ship strikes the iceberg, the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch. Titanic remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heart-breaking romance.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10</div>",Positive
512,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this movie is the best movie i seen in years. This movie is about 3 hours long and it felt like the movie was only 1 hour. Leonardo DiCaprio did an awesome job in this movie. So as Kate Winslet. James Cameron is the best director ever. This movie made me cry. The very last part is very sad. A very good movie about a titanic ship and about a women's life. All the people who think this is a f*** sh** think again... Cause' If you hate this movie you have no life. Anyways very sad and good movie. This movie is very underrated. It should be in the top 250 list. I recommend this movie highly. Please go see it now! My Rating:10/10</div>",Positive
513,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">i don't care what this so called critics think about this film.personally i fell that this is the greatest movie ever made in the entire film industry of this planet.A touching and a memorable love story that every one keeps in their minds and a true incident of a disaster told in very heart full way.i think everyone watched dis movie will justify that.Am just disappointed to see such a low rating given to this film.There are many films IMDb with ratings above 9 that doesn't come any where near to this film.I don't want to name those films but this a true injustice done to this film after giving a true film for us to keep in our minds for the rest our lifes</div>",Positive
514,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic in April 1912. Among the many passengers is drifter Jack Dawson(played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who meets unhappy heiress-to-be Rose Dewitt(played by Kate Winslet) and fall mutually in love as disaster strikes the ship, resulting in its sinking, and the loss of many lives. An old version of Rose(played by Gloria Stuart) recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure hunters(led by Bill Paxton) who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck, which Rose does indeed know something about... Hated by some, resented by others, I still love this film, which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture, with outstanding F/X that are still realistic. The full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all, which is put in proper perspective. Some dialogue could have been better, it's true, but compelling drama at its best, leading to an emotionally devastating end. Deservedly won many Academy Awards, including best picture, director, and song ""My Heart Will Go On""!</div>",Positive
515,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor! He did a great job in this film. He is my favorite actor ever and he's just great! He has talent and puts his whole self into his career! He doesn't just go halfway! He goes all the way!! He is a very inspiring person! I would like to meet him one day! He has 28 great films although I haven't seen them all, but he's in them so they have to be great! Haha!! Ever since he was little he knew he wanted to be an actor and now he's living his dream! And he is doing a great job at it! Every movie he does he's great! It's not something he takes lightly! Thank you Leo for your great work!! ❤ :) Keep it up! Never stop! Wonderful...just wonderful!! :)</div>",Positive
516,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We all know what the film is based of off, and we expected that. But what I'm sure that audiences didn't expect was a plot as deep as it gets. With an amazing and large cast, Titanic offers more teardrops then a funeral. One thing that stands out over everything else is the fantastic musical score by James Horner and Celine Deon. Possibly the best since Hans Zimmer in the Lion King in 1994. Titanic released in 1997 changed cinema as we know it. Offering a deep, and emotional story with performance you will enjoy with your eyes, and music that you will be humming for years to come. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates are amongst one of the largest cast in film history (up to that point). It is a film you will have to see to not only believe, but enjoy as well. This is James Cameron's Titanic.</div>",Positive
517,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance-disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.<br/><br/>I love the film very much. Every time I am moved to tears. I am filled with heartrending sorrow. However the heroine live strongly after the parson who she loves, so I am encouraged. The music of the film is also good. I love the song, My Heat Will Go on, sung by Celine Dion. The film contains love story element and panic element, so we never lost interest in the film. The film is loved all over the world, so I want you to watch it.</div>",Positive
518,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw Titanic 4 times when it came out ... Still in theaters. I've never done that. Not before or since. It is not just the story of the sinking or the loss of life. I mean...there's that story, well-told. But the love story of Jack and Rose told against the backdrop of an epic disaster is so poignant. It was a phenomenon...the movie was. I watched it again tonight ... 20 years later, and it holds up even now. Titanic is James Cameron's Mona Lisa. His Free Bird. A masterpiece. Don't listen to the naysayers and haters commenting here on IMDb ...that it's overrated. If anything a film that garnered 11 academy awards rated a 7.7 on IMDb is grossly UNDERrated. It's a beautiful film still.</div>",Positive
519,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will watch this film over and over and I will never get tired. Jack &amp; Rose are beautifully people and the story is brilliant. Dope movie</div>",Positive
520,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched it 3/4 times... Best movie.... everyone should watch this movie...</div>",Positive
521,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">TITANIC..one of my best favorite movie of all times..I watched the movie so many times..that i couldn't count it anymore! I just love the movie..I like the love story of it..I can watch the movie over and over and over again.I just cant get over it..I find it very sweet..romantic..but yet very sad..I like every part of it..from beginning till the end..Jack and Rose never left each other.. no matter what they stick together..but the thing I hate bout it Jack died..thats the only part I didn't like its too sad...but other than that..its the BEST!!!! It's very touching story..Every time I watch it..I feel like I'm part of it or something...I find it very good..I got nothing else to say bout it..but IT IS THE BEST!!!!</div>",Positive
522,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In 1996 I saw Titanic for the first time. I immediately knew this movie would make history. I heard and read all the criticism, especially by men. But let's be honest. This movie is the best love/drama/action movie of our era. It shows a lovestory in the middle of a historic disaster. I think we all search for such a love but seldom find it. Di Caprio does a great job, so does everybody else. But the heart of the movie is Kate Winslet. She should have won an Oscar for this role. Now in 2012 I saw Titanic 3D. Amazing! This film wasn't recorded in 3D but you can't tell. And the film still has that magic. If I ever get to be 90, I will still be watching it once every year. And it will still have it's magic. Well done James Cameron!</div>",Positive
523,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen, along with Braveheart, Gallipoli, The Godfather and Scarface.  The film has such good actors, who can change their mood from bright and happy to terrified and sad.  Definetly worth watching and the ending made me cry every time I watched the movie, and I've watched it about three times.  Titanic is a classic.</div>",Positive
524,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie I've ever seen. It's very historically accurate, they even used the same type of wood that was on the real Titanic. I don't know why some people don't like this movie. Every time I read a bad comment I ask myself. ""Do these people know anything about the REAL Titanic"" or ""Have they even seen it"". The actors were great. As well as the special effects.</div>",Positive
525,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie has everything you could possibly desire. It's got great sound, great music, great digital effects, great actors, great sets, great script...the list goes on and on. If you haven't seen this movie then put on your shoes and run down to the video store at once and enjoy your evening...I'm sure you will.</div>",Positive
526,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie it was moving and caused me to sob at this unnecessary tragedy's occureence.I thought that both Leo and Kate were amazing and portrayed the characters not only efficiently but to the point where you have to remind yourself that it is just a movie.I truly enjoyed it and agree with many writers when they say that all girls wish it was them kissing Jack because I too wish it was me kissing him maybe not on the Titanic though.</div>",Positive
527,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a great movie! The story is brilliantly written, the actors, especially Kate Winslet, do a very good job and the pictures are so powerful. All in all, it is the most touching film I've ever seen -and I've seen a lot of them. By the way, I'm a guy, I'm 20 years old and I normally hate love stories. But this is really cinema at its best.<br/><br/>I can't believe that there are people who disliked this movie. How can one ignore the magic in this story? To call it ""worst movie ever made"" is just ridiculous. Go watch Godzilla or Deep Impact if you're looking for a movie that sucks! I really loved this one and I think it's a shame that some people have to spit on everything!</div>",Positive
528,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">after seeing this flick had to read any materials I could on the subject (read about 10 books and it truly is an amazing story).Effects laden, it is a very quick moving 3 hour extravaganza.</div>",Positive
529,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The score for this film, and the soaring musical sequences while the leads are on the bow of the ship at dusk before the sinking will go down in history as one of the most unforgettable moments of movie making genius. Rent or buy the video if you haven't already!</div>",Positive
530,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thr first time i saw this amazing film i was immediately mezmerized by it. I wanted to find out all i could about this movie, as well as the real disaster. I have always been amazed of the TITANIC disaster. and i think James Cameron did a fine job of how the maritime disaster really happened and how it really was.</div>",Positive
531,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one terrific movie.  Corny love story, but the actors make it believable and it keeps you glued to the screen, even though you know how it's going to end.  Fantastic special effects and soundtrack.  See this movie for yourself and make your own decision.  But . . . keep the tissues handy!</div>",Positive
532,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a very good movie that was both entertaining and sad, that had a great love story. The special effects were great as was the acting. 10!! Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, language, nudity, and sensuality.</div>",Positive
533,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I kinda had the impression that it was only a ""Chick Flick""....but boy was I wrong! It truly deserved all of the hype it received. What can I say..typical James Cameron!<br/><br/>One of the best movies of all time!</div>",Positive
534,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all, I would like to say that I'm not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio! In fact, I hate him as a person. (He is a good actor though).<br/><br/>What makes me such a fan of Titanic? I'm one of those Titanic fanatics, so it can't be the love story. No, it is the history of the SHIP Titanic that fascinates me. To see the ship in a motion picture was just great. The effects were superb. If the R.M.S Titanic fascinates you, go see the movie.<br/><br/>One last thing: The movie would probably be better without Leo!</div>",Positive
535,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really liked this movie. The only thing I don't understand is the craze that it triggered. I've seen a few better movies, and a LOT worse. The storyline was good, the acting was so-so, so all in all it was a pretty good movie. But save yourself the energy, and don't obsess over it!</div>",Positive
536,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is in my opinion the best movie of all time. 30 years from now it will be a classic like Gone With the Wind. I think the Academy Awards people were right in giving it 11 awards including best picture. And that's the bottom line cause I said so.</div>",Positive
537,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perhaps a little cheesy in the scripting (if you're picky), but at least that's the only thing wrong, of all the possible things that could have sunk this wonder.<br/><br/>Hype?  When I saw it, the only hype I had heard was a Washington Post article that started 'Love story sinks Titanic', printed several weeks before the movie's release.  I saw it on new year's eve, and was completely impressed.  I barely noticed the 3 hours pass as I was totally drawn in by Cameron's effective presentation.  If you haven't seen this because you ""already know the ship sinks"", you're fooling yourself: the ship sinks in a computer model in the first 5 minutes, so nothing you see is a surprise. SEE IT.  thank you.  ;)</div>",Positive
538,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One thing about Titanic is for sure: Is the most successful film in the 20th century. It made a kazillion at the box office and picked a pile of Oscars and other awards. The Titanic craze grew to the point of making people sick of it (including myself).<br/><br/>It's no surprise why a lot of people hate this film as much as the people who love it: The lack of chemistry of the DeCaprio and Winslet couple. The laughable acting of DeCaprio. And finally, the cliche and often ridiculous dialog (In certain part of the movie, the chip was in climax-sinking mode, people were dying like flies. The first thing our heroine occurred to say was ""This is where we first met!"").<br/><br/>Despite the movie's flaws Titanic manages to hit a nerve on us all. The experience is completely immersive and the film's last hour makes up for all the romance rubbish. It's no question it's a very well done movie and its worth every penny people paid to see it.</div>",Positive
539,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is probably one of the finest Epic movies of our time. It will surely have its place as a classic for years to come. For the monumental budget and phenomenal cast, it lives up to its hype. James Cameron did a superfluous recreation of the tragic ill-fated voyage. The personal drama and romance only further pull us in and connect us with the past. We ""feel"" the pleasure, the pain, the loss with the characters, vicariously though the vivid sets, dynamic characters and heartwrenching plot.<br/><br/>Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet were truly cheated at the awards; but their performance in TITANIC will be well-remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>It is truly a masterpiece in its own time. But what more can really be said about it than has already be said?</div>",Positive
540,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic.  It speaks for itself.  The name means huge.  That is what this movie was. Huge.  You could tell that Winslet, DiCaprio, Stuart, Paxton, Zane, and everyone else really loved working.  At times they referred to Cameron as a ""tyrant"".  I can see why.  Working on a movie that has a budget more than some countries have to spend is pretty difficult.  Cameron squeezed emotion out of monotone Leo and proper Kate.  (Has anyone noticed that in every movie she plays she is wealthy)  For that, we owe Cameron, and the cast, a round of applause.</div>",Positive
541,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What I don't see is how people can flame a story of love.  Yes I DO see how they can flame the hype.  But if there wasn't a lot of hype, I bet trillions MORE people would love this movie.  It was a record of history.  If they make a movie about Amelia Earhart or The Kennedys, I wonder if people will be as inconsiderate as the did of the R.M.S. Titanic.  I loved the movie. Every time I saw it I cried.  The couple behind me were hitting me on the head trying to shut me up.  I couldn't help it.  Now I must admit.  I am a Leo fan.  And I mean an obsessed fan.  You should see my room-DANG!  Anyway, I think Leo is the best actor around.  Don't start to label me as another TEENYBOPPER.  He's had some rough spots (like Critters 3) but he's come a long way.  The people who flame him are obviously jealous.  Everyone wants to be admired.  All I am saying is please don't flame a movie that went down in history.   @bby Leo's #1 fan.  (NOT JOKING)</div>",Positive
542,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well I think that Titanic is best movie of all time. Not only was there a great story line and also The detail of the ship were spot on. I went to see the movie eight times at the movies and it was well worth the money and each and every time I found out something new about the titanic form this film and I would love to se the dirctors cut of this movie. Even though the movie go's for over three hours the dirctors would be well worth releasing in the near furture. I felt part of it all when I was at movies it is the best movie I have ever seen And I wish it was still at the movies even though I have my own copy of the film on video. You can beat the big screen.</div>",Positive
543,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">TITANIC is a wonderful film! That is why it got all the attention it got. It was completely oscar-worthy. Leo was robbed of an Oscar! For all the idiots out there who keep bashing this film and the acting, well i'd just LOVE to see you go up and act!!! If Leo wasn't an excellent actor, he wouldn't be where he is today! Titanic completely deserved all the oscars and the attention it got, and it will not soon be forgotten. a classic, it can totally rival Gone with the wind.a lot of people are really being unfair to this movie, saying the only reason it got all the attention was because of Leo-crazed teenage girls. This isn't true!!! A Lot of people went to see it, not just teenage girls. It became the wonderful classic it is because of it's wonderful enduring love story that touched the hearts of millions world-wide. I think all of the fools who keep bashing this film are jealous. Don't ask me what their jealous of, they just are!!! Titanic rules!!!</div>",Positive
544,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is probably the greatest movie ever made! The love story is so beautiful, and the attention to detail is excellent! The acting is amazing, and the special effects are breath-taking! A true classic! No matter what you like in movies, be it romance, adventure, drama, comedy, tragedy, special effects, it is all in this one movie! And as a student of history, the attention to historical details is wonderful!</div>",Positive
545,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An excellent film which gave a real sense of what it must have been like to be involved in such a disaster with almost no hope of rescue. The real star is the ship, but Kate Winslet and Billy Zane give great performances. Many of the smaller roles are excellent, particularly crew members. The Irish band are brilliant,the costumes are gorgeous and the attention to detail is top class. Leonardo di Caprio makes a good fist of his role but really any half way competent actor could have done the job. Overall though,the only main reservation is the script!</div>",Positive
546,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of the best movies of the decade. Interestingly, it was the official script book that got me to notice this film ... since I took pains to IGNORE Titanic when it first came out. I thought the hype was a bit too much, and I really hated Celine Dion's performance on an otherwise excellent song. Now that I have seen the film, I can't see what many people are complaining about. The b-story of Jack and Rose's romance is touching and never dull, the historical facts are generally accurate, except for a few minor errors. But a lot of people forget this film is told from the point of view of a 101-year-old woman! I rarely find myself choking up watching a film, but this show did it to me -- the only other movie ever to make me cry is the excellent Hawks (1989). Repeated viewings of Titanic only make the experience better, because you get to see different things each time. By the way, anyone staying away from Titanic because of Celine Dion will be happy to note her song doesn't appear until the closing credits ...  the rest of the time James Horner's exquisite work carries the film.</div>",Positive
547,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Since all the things there is to say about this film has allready been said, I'm not gonna say anything about it.<br/><br/>Except: If you have not seen this masterpiece by James Cameron, what are you waiting for!!?? Go out there, and rent it...or buy it...! This is a movie not to be missed; Spectacular, world-class effects; excellent acting; magnificent story; wonderful photography, superb music alive with tense atmosphere. It's Cameron's best movie ever. If that doesn't mean anything to you, you've missed out on some very good movies...But, like said, this is the best one! And this is one movie you don't wanna miss!</div>",Positive
548,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We just saw the movie now and after two years of hype I was ready for disappointment. But I wasn't a bit. I was spellbound from start to finish. When Jack and Rose hit the water I took a deep breath. We've actually watched it through twice in the same week. That never happens. Titanic was well done in every aspect: acting, music, effects, realism. We never noticed a model or a computer-enhancement (not that we looked too hard) while we were wrapped up in this story. Even though I knew how it ended I couldn't wait to see what happens next.</div>",Positive
549,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is truly an epic motion picture and in my opinion one of the best films of all time.  The movie has a deep and powerful center to it that cannot be accurately described in words.  All I can say, is that I felt like it was more like an experience than just a movie.  You almost felt as if you were on the Titanic.  Everything about the movie is awesome from the soundtrack to the special effects.  James Cameron is a great director and I would like to thank him for making such an amazing film.</div>",Positive
550,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think James Cameron's Titanic is the best movie ever made. It offers something for everybody. I think that Leonardo Dicaprio should have at least been nominated for the Oscar for best actor. The film was well acted and well scripted. The visual effects are unmatched. There simply is no better movie!</div>",Positive
551,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron's ""Titanic"", is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. The intricate love story, set on board one of the 20th century's worst disasters, was superb. The score, the visuals, the special effects, the acting, etc.....all combined to make this film the phenomenal achievement that it is. This film pulls you back in time to 1912, on board the famous ship with its doomed passengers. You come to feel close to Jack and Rose, all the while aware that certain doom is just ahead of them. The film is sobering and fittingly emotional, as too many lost their lives. Husbands and wives torn apart forever, as were large and small families, and of course...Jack and Rose. At least until the end, when Rose finally passes away and returns to Jack...on board Titanic. ""Titanic"" is absolutely spellbinding, engrossing, and an incredible film experience. A definite 10.</div>",Positive
552,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a great movie, a heart felt perspective on a heart felt tragedy. The movie was awesome.  Very few historically accurate movies can be this good, it's worth all 600 million it has brought in at the box office.</div>",Positive
553,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think the best deserved award for this movie was the Best Soundtrack Oscar. Imagine Titanic without its marvellous music. Both action and emotional scenes in the movie, but especially emotional, wouldn't be the same if we watched it without the music James Horner created. I think both music and images are 50% important in the final result. But some movies have their main weight in their music.</div>",Positive
554,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was impressed very much by this movie, not for its pictures or its director's talents, but I liked it just for the sake of the extraordinary romance happening between well chosen Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. Of course the glorious romantic song ""My Heart Will Go On"" sang by Celine Dion was one of the effective factors that made the movie a heart-breaking modern piece of romance.</div>",Positive
555,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">what more could a film viewer want comedy, romance , tragedy, a baddy etc etc - excellent film from all angles. 1997 but a film definitely to watch over and over again the music score added to a superb film</div>",Positive
556,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I liked the movie very much, because Rose and Jack were played very good. The director made very good use of the existing theories about the Titanic, like how it sunk, how everything was, etc... On the end the movie was very exciting, but some parts before were funny and also impressive. This was a movie that made great impact to me compared to other movies. So over all: A great movie, I would recommend it to everyone</div>",Positive
557,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now, I've seen a LOT of films in my time.  I've loved a lot of films in my time.  But ""Titanic"" simply tops them all. Sure, some of the criticisms this film has been given are not terribly off-the-mark, but I don't see them.  I have watched this film over and over again, and never tire of it. This film is terribly rich in detail.  While DiCaprio and Winslet are brilliant in the leads, it's really the supporting cast that shines.  I was especially impressed with Gloria Stuart (who I still think should have won the Oscar in 97).  Also absolutely brilliant is Victor Garber as Mr. Andrews.  His part is small but absolutely heart-breaking, and definitely my favourite element in the film. Of course, the cinematography, editing, score, etc. are all as brilliant as you'd expect from an ""epic"" and more.  But it's the underlying messages in this film that truly ""makes it count.""  It makes me happy that such an intelligent film is also the top-grossing film of all time. Definitely worth seeing again... and again!  10 out of 10.</div>",Positive
558,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is excellent.`Titanic` is a poetic impulse. The direction inspires respect and hope. Cameron is very talented (see `The Abyss`) Rose`s and Jack`s personalities inspire me. Kate is an amazing actress, her acting in every movie is a exceptional phenomenon with emotional result.  SIMPLY THE BEST.</div>",Positive
559,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have seen this movie many times and it gets better and better each time. James Cameron did a great work, because he combined the great special effects of the Titanic downfall with the love story between Jake (Leo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet).</div>",Positive
560,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron's Oscar winning Titanic was a great film that could be even better if given some better dialogue and some more mature acting.  Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do well in their roles, but a lot of the dialogue from Cameron is weak at best.  Winslet succeeds in her role much better than DiCaprio, although both have their good moments and their weak spots.  The supporting cast helps to bring the real life people of the Titanic to life, most notably by Kathy Bates.  What Cameron lacks in dialogue writing, he more than makes up for in the accuracy of the re-created ship and it's icy plunge into the frigid North Atlantic.  The film is worth viewing for the scenes of the ship's sinking alone.  James Horner's musical score is also terrific.  Cameron and crew have succeeded in making a grand epic as in days of old.  Get past the cheesy lines of the 2 stars and you will be in for one great ride.</div>",Positive
561,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">excellent work by cameron he always does it the right way. The movie has all the ingredients that an all out film should have. there is something there for most of us to see it is a great experience and i hope to se more of its caliber from cameron in the future.</div>",Positive
562,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">WOW.  This movie deserves every single one of it's Oscar awards.  The acting, directing, modeling of the ship, ect.  Excellent.  If you haven't seen this movie ( I had long ago, but didn't have the time to post a comment) Shame on you.  This has got to be one of the movies people will watch in the next generations.</div>",Positive
563,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This happens every time: When a person, a company, a product, whatever you like, is extremely successful, people start to criticize it very hard. This is called ""envy"". Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. Period. James Cameron's dive to the real titanic to get a mere 12 minutes of footage deserves alone 11 Academy Awards. Please people, wake up. This picture is a truly masterpiece. Take off your hats! You are in front of the 1.9 billion wonder that Titanic is.</div>",Positive
564,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is my all time favorite film and the very best film of the last ten years. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Jack. The direction, art direction and cinematography are all top notch. Titanic is easily the best film of the last ten years worthy of it's 11 Oscars and rank as all time box office champ. No film of the last ten years comes anywhere near Titanic.</div>",Positive
565,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Rose certainly got it right at the end of the movie when she says to Cal, ""You unimaginable bastard "". I don't think I've ever liked Billy Zane after this movie. His character is evil, conniving, ruthless and just plain clueless. I think one of the most exciting parts of this movie is when Rose is looking for Jack after he is taken to the room and handcuffed to the pipe in the Criminals' Passage. I love it when she pushes the guy into the elevator and forces him to go down to E Deck. The entire scene after Rose finds Jack is amazing as well, all of the water and special effects are incredible... Makes you think what you would do in that situation. Rose knows that there is a good chance she may never find Jack and die in the process, but shes determined anyway. So emotional !! I think this movie is outstanding and will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, just as Titanic has gone down in history as one of the greatest mysteries and tragedies of all time.</div>",Positive
566,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love Titanic. It is a really good movie. I think that Jack Dawson is really cute. The actor who played Jack Dawson did a very good job. He is a very good actor. They picked the right person to play Jack Dawson. No one else could have done a better job that the person who played Jack Dawson. Kate Winslet did a good job on the movie. The way she played her part was great. The way Leonardo did a great job on the movie. The way he played his part was great. Titanic will always be a great movie in my heart. Titanic is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It will always be a special movie in my heart. The cast did a great job on Titanic. Titanic should have won more awards. The awards it won were very good awards. The movie Titanic really does shine.</div>",Positive
567,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know why people are kinda afraid to admit they like Titanic. I love this movie and I say it! My friends came home to watch it with me. It was the first time they saw it and they laughed at me until the movie began. In the end they were all crying! After that we made a group for Titanic lovers... Some people thought we were strange, but they all admitted they had seen Titanic and liked it. When I saw this wonderful film was only rated 7, I was disappointed. By reading the comments I realised people discriminate Titanic because it's a classic tragic love story.Don't be afraid to like Titanic. That's what makes us different!</div>",Positive
568,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is seriously my favorite movie. It has all the elements of a great movie: romance, tragedy, lost love, disaster... its great! The characters are wonderful, and the script is beautiful. The new special edition DVD has a ton of extras, including some never-before-seen deleted scenes. In my opinion, its a good thing those scenes were left on the cutting room floor, though. As far as scenery, you couldn't ask for a more beautiful film visually. Even though most of it is digital, it really has the feel of being on the Titanic with Rose and Jack. The costumes alone are enough to take your breath away. The love between Jack and Rose is unparalleled, and I couldn't ask for a better film to have a good cry to. This film deserved the best picture Oscar in 1998, I love this movie, and I hope you do too.</div>",Positive
569,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well I don't really have time to write much so I'd just like to say that in my opinion Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. It's my favorite and takes my breath away every time. I've seen it about 50 times lol I always cry too Also, I wish people would stop saying it's a bad movie just for the sake of being different - It's a beautiful love story and great film so get over it. I have to write 10 lines??!!! Well, it's a great movie And if you don't like it then you have no soul LOL OK...well I think the acting is great too and it's nice to see an actress like Kate Winslet who isn't anorexic i wish they had made it longer lol i love it!</div>",Positive
570,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just love this movie Kate Winselt and Leonardo Dicaprio are really good actors. I hope I will be able to see them in a film together sometime down the road. It is just my absolute favorite movie ever! There may have been many mistakes but it still pulled together very nicely. I could not think of any better actors to have played in this film. The ending was sad but excellent at the same time. I definitely give this movie a ten. It must have took a lot of money and time but they were very successful. I am still torn by the fact that it happened in real life; I am sure it was ten times more devastating then. I recommend everybody to see this film. Thank you for reading.</div>",Positive
571,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron takes the story of the Titanic disaster and transforms it into a wonderful, breathtaking movie.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around two lovers, Jack and Rose who come from very different worlds. We watch as conflict unfolds with Rose's family and her decisions about Jack. Then the iceberg hits. The movie then turns from a romance to a action/survival story. We are thrown into the devastating sinking of Titanic. Even though we know how the movie ends (the ship sinks) we are still able to become caught up in the movie. Although their are a few questionable parts, the overall movie is amazing</div>",Positive
572,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic was one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. I have always been fascinated with the story of the once, ""greatest ship of its time"". DiCaprio and Winslet were amazing. The movie came together beautifully. The special effects were mystifying, and put you almost on the Titanic. This movies touched my heart as I watched what those people went through, it was heart breaking. This truly was a great accomplishment of James Cameron and all the cast and crew. I think that this movie has showed people more of what happened that night in 1912. I would most definitely recommend you rent or buy this movie. It was simply perfect.</div>",Positive
573,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">its now 1 a.m.and before going to sleep .i need to salute this movie as its unfair not say a single word for this movie before going to sleep,i re watched it after a long time and after went to my bed, ,i looked intently at the roof for about half and hour and could not believe that those people on ship were gone through all this.and all the unimaginable LOVE fr kate and jack even though this was a fiction movie and some of the facts might be different ,but this movie produced by a human,James is extra xtra ordinary,i give damn to all faults in the movie pointed by ur any of the viewer .in spite of all those faults,which were noticed and calculated by the viewers after their sheer hard work,to say something against this movie as its part of their nature to be critic ALWAYS an ordinary viewer won,t mind them come on,the movie is fr us to enjoy,to feel the pain,and to understand all the agonies ,no one is perfect,</div>",Positive
574,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic WAS known as the ship of dreams, but NOW is known as the movie of dreams. It is every director's dream to make a movie such as Titanic. It has become a grading scale for movies of today. At first I had no interest in seeing Titanic, but after all my friends saw it and wouldn't shut up about it I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Boy was I blown away. I have never seen a movie like it before. This is one of the few movies I have actually bought. I was completely satisfied in every way a movie goer should be satisfied. The Detail in the movie was unbelievable from the costumes, props, and set design. The music fit the movie perfectly, not one cue was out of place. All the acting was good especially from Kate Winslet and Gloria Stewart. If I had to state a negative about the movie the only thing I could possibly think of would TIME. This movie is LONG!!! But it is good, and I think it is well worth taking 3 hours out of your life to take a fascinating journey back to the heart of Titanic.</div>",Positive
575,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">ha! this movie was fantastic....i don't understand how people could not like it i mean...its pure brilliance.....it deserves 10 hands down...i will admit i cried....like a baby....and so did my girlfriend....but it was great i really felt like i knew the characters and thats not common in movies of today....I've seen it i don't know how many times and the end still gets me...also the music...like it or not....was perfect.....beautiful.....its a great love story...had me intwined.....every time i watch it it has the same effect i cant keep my eyes off the screen...and if u have never seen it i suggest you do...this movie is great</div>",Positive
576,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie I have ever seen!!!! I absolutely love it. I search my cable channels every day just to see if it's on, and I watch it every time. Lost track of how many times I've seen it, but it's enough to have memorized the entire 3 hours and 14 minutes (seriously!!). This is definitely a must see, over and over again. It never gets boring. Granted, 3 hours and 14 minutes seems long, but it goes by so quickly. The movie is over so quickly. I really want them to re-release it next December in the movie theater for the 10 year anniversary. If you haven't seen it, definitely head to out and buy it immediately. Any DVD collection is not complete without it (or a few copies like me in case one of them breaks or wears out from too much usage!!!).</div>",Positive
577,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is an excellent film and a very good costume drama i absolutely loved this film from beginning to end Kate and leo i think are fantastic actor and played the part very well unfortunately with tragic consequences it made me cry at the end and made people think about the class differences and those poor people who died on that ship. Titanic a wonderful movie tearful and heart stopping. One of the best scenes is when jack and rose go dancing to Irish music and rose gets tipsy when she balance's on her toes i thought that must of hert her feet. this film get 10 out of 10 from me a must see movie i would recommend it to anyone.</div>",Positive
578,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">the acting was just the right depth for its time of which it was set in. i feel that Leonardo DeCaprio portrayed his character Jack very well and emotionally, isn't it a shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination. i would like Kate Winslet to never play her character Rose again due to her perfected version now. i doubt sincerely that a lot of people love this film due to its other meanings which in my view are out side the box of many critics of the film. think about it. i do feel the direction was OK and the cinematography was up to standard. i was freaked at my immediate 10/10 because i so reluctantly give films this. also i would like to add it didn't make me cry it just made me feel very attached with the characters.</div>",Positive
579,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's amazing. This movie is just incredible. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are absolutely awesome. I can't see any one else playing these two roles in this movie as well as they did. <br/><br/>I don't think that i have ever seen any better special effects in any movie that i've seen before. Even the music ""brought the moment"" of the time in the movie.I'm not even closed to surprised that this movie won eleven Oscars.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is probably one of the saddest movies that i have ever seen in my life. But you must see this movie if haven't yet (which i am surprised if you haven't). You will definitely not regret it.</div>",Positive
580,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a great love story set in the hands of a historical background, with a phenomenal plot, Titanic is one of the greatest stories ever. Where survivor Rose, is narrating the story she experienced herself, back to her seventeen engaged self to the heir of steel tycoon Nathan Hockley, his son Caledon. Rose feels trapped, but on her stay on Titanic finds Jack Dawson by fate, who she shares a personal and special connection with. The dreams he is already living she aspires, and there fore an amazing chemistry is formed between the two. Until an iceberg hits, and their love for each other is tested, by powerful means. Its a race for survival, and the passengers are doomed. With an amazing cast, this tale comes to life on the big screen, and will always be remembered.</div>",Positive
581,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, I have to say that I was only 5yrs old when this movie came out and I saw it in theaters when it did. I fell in love with it that same day. I wasn't sure I understood the entire story, but something at the age of 5 sparked my imagination and it was just wonderful. I think this movie has a great mix of such wonderful actors and a great director. Everything about this movie was wonderful. I have to say this will always be my favorite movie. And it was because of Kate Winslet that sparked my imagination and I've wanted to be an actress. So i owe her a great deal of thanks even though I have never met her, but would Love to meet her. This movie was certainly one for the ages. And I think they showed a lot of emotion and it just left me in awe. I hope you all feel the same way.</div>",Positive
582,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a brilliant movie. Trust me, I own the DVD on Special Edition. The scenes are all gut-wrenching, and I always cry on several occasions each time I see it. I think that one of the brilliant things about it is that many of the lines weren't in the script, butt were developed by DiCaprio and Winslet, such as when Leo says, ""Lie on that bed, uh, I mean couch."" It was an honest mistake, but James Cameron liked it so much that he kept it. Really, it's one of my favorite lines in the movie because he loves her so much. Hint, hint. I really feel that this movie deserves every award on the face of the earth, and I would recommend it to anyone.</div>",Positive
583,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved the movie when I saw it. Mainly I like the movie because of Leonardo DiCaprio, he's such a great actor. I've seen all of his movies including The Departed which I just saw today in theaters. Titanic is probably the only really romantic movie that I am willing to watch again and again, alone or with someone else. When they say that the Titanic kiss was the most famous, they weren't kidding. Man I'd LOVE to have someone kiss ME like that on the bow of a famous ship the day the ship was supposed to sink. That personally is just really romantic that even though they are both doomed (one to death, and one to lose the love of her life) they still share that passionate moment for a few seconds on the ship, very romantic...:)</div>",Positive
584,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I first saw this movie while living out in Cyprus, and I loved it. Everything about it was fantastic, I didn't want it to end. The cast was great, I thought Kathy Bates was perfect as Molly Brown, but Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were terrific as Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater, they had me on the edge of my seat, I was almost crying by the end of it, and I sure i'm not the only one, thanks to Leonardo's magnificent performance. The grand staircase was my favourite part of the ship, it was beautiful, every tiny detail just took my breath away. I have watched this film so many times now, but I still can't get enough of it. From the incredible sets, to the amazing costumes, this film is truly magical,</div>",Positive
585,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Titanic was and he will always be one of the best films of always. Carried through of one it forms sufficiently professional, and with an actress who in mine opinion is simply excellent: Kate Winslet! I have immense penalty that still it has much people that do not give the due value to this film. I think that all its particularities are simply excellent, wants graphical, wants of performance of the actors. James Cameron disclosed great qualities while accomplishing (and already in he has accustomed them to such), and to rebate, James Horner, with a sonorous band the height of this great film. Optimum of always! Congratulations everybody.</div>",Positive
586,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. Yes, it's my favorite movie. Why, you may ask? Titanic has something for everyone: romance, action, drama, and even a little bit of comedy. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are expertly cast as two lovers who meet on the doomed ship, the Titanic. Heartbreakingly beautiful, this movie will touch your life. I remember the first time I saw Titanic. The only thing I could think of was, ""Wow. How can they ever make a better movie?"" I recommend this movie to everyone, because there is no possible way you can not find something you can love in what is one of the best movies of all time...Titanic.</div>",Positive
587,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Although Im a girl, I did not watch this film to see Leonardo Dicaprio, It was actually because of watching th film for the first time that I fell in love with him.The acting and effects are amazing with a gripping storyline to go with them. This has definitely got to be my all time favourite but I don't want to start an argument with anyone who thinks it was crap. I personally loved it and If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should. You may not enjoy it, in which case you would have just wasted three hours of your life but if you do enjoy it...thats three hours definitely worth wasting on the film again. Warning...it may cause tears!</div>",Positive
588,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well not much to say just amazing movie by James Cameron mixing drama and romance i highly recommend for everyone to watch this amazing movie Just one of the best drama ever made A perfect creation by James Cameron A perfect acting By the actors. Unique movie. fascinating and exciting movie Some very sad scenes take us to the very end none of the less just amazing movie A wise man once said :""one picture worth a thousand words"". one of those popcorn-Coca cola movies . if this movie is ""over hyped"" we have only to blame public this movie is just amazing,therefore i think he should get 9 rate a unique movie. However This movie is very long and not all peoples have time to watch 3 hours for a movie it's just too long. Some very sad scenes tears dropping and death much dead people died in the titanic 1500 dead people only 6 manage to escape out from the drowning of the titanic</div>",Positive
589,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know why people complain about the affects they are wonderful and me I am a Titanic fan a big one not for the movie but for the ship I have done a lout of research before I saw this movie and when I saw the movie I was amazed of how well it followed the history I wish he showed what happened on the Carpathia though because that was a battle as well as the night it sank but it was already a long movie so I cant blame him and if anyone thinks Jack and Rose were really passengers on Titanic they are wrong but that is OK I had that same question when I watched it but they did great what happened that night and it makes me fell apart of Titanic when I leave if anyone is interested in the the Titanic they can see Ghoust of the Abyss James Cameron directed it and he is in it the movie is about him and his crew diving down to the ship and some of the history you will also notice some of the actors in the movie Titanic in that documentary but it is entertaining and funny in some parts</div>",Positive
590,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If there's any movie that will make you fall in love, this would be it. The setting is beautiful and the performances from the cast compliment the film nicely, particularly the leading roles portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and the deservedly Oscar-winning Kate Winslet. The romance shown is one that will have you in tears and will make you fall in love yourself. You do engage with all the characters nicely, particularly couples watching who are in love themselves, the story really draws you in, and also the ending is almost guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues as you dry your tears. There is no wonder that this is considered possibly the most romantic movie ever shown on screen and the ultimate tear-jerker!</div>",Positive
591,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A true moving epic that quite literally moves you off your feet as you are swept into a class driven land of its own. Cameron will never better this film as it is the best he's ever made in my opinion. The acting is top notch, the script is even better and his use of colour, fades, and cuts make the movie a true work of art. The storyline cannot be questioned throughout as it is 100% true which is the true beauty of this utter work of art...I must have seen this film over 10 times and every time i watch it the music is outstanding and use to superb effect throughout the film. This tear dropping epic should be seen by all and admired by all of us. Cameron Avatar was amazing but this is better...</div>",Positive
592,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let me start by saying that I watched Cameron's Titanic several times and each time with the same interest and feelings. I am a male, but this movie brings tears to my eyes every single time. Obviously not everybody is affected by it it as much as I was, perhaps expecting to see a documentary rather then romance and a sad story (wonderfully acted and filmed by the way). One should realize that this is far from a clinical examination of how the most famous ocean liner actually sank, but is really a story about love and devotion which just happens (whether real or not) to take place on a sinking ship. I do not believe Cameron intended to give an accurate account of an historical event here, and I am surprised how some critics fail to realize this.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a historical documentary, you won't find it here, but if you like a very well made romantic movie, some wonderful acting from Winslet and DiCaprio, and a drama created by a sinking ship you've come to the right place.</div>",Positive
593,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the latest inquiries about this film's re-release was how it is in 3D. Pretty damn dazzling I would say. The details are more enriched, dark scenes are surprisingly crisp &amp; clear and the entire experience is unforgettable. Re-mastered right from the ground up, In 3D, Titanic is a much more intimate experience. The visual effects are still better than most CGI films that comes out these days. Featuring epic depiction of disaster that very few movies can match, exceptional music by James Horner that today is easily one of the most recognizable scores, and last but not the least, James Cameron, who has always pushed the boundaries of technology in film-making to new levels, for crafting it with such care and dedication that it made the whole world fall in love with it, again. So take the journey, fall in love and experience Titanic, like never before.</div>",Positive
594,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is so well done. The quality is amazing and both actors did a super great job. What I like most about the movie is that the Rose and Jack were friends and lovers at the same time. The love theme in the movie is great and there are a lot of heart-touching moments that you have to see. This movie will make you capable of falling in love again and again! Nice romantic vibes. And Leo Dicaprio is gorgeous and Kate is beautiful as well. If you are so into romance, I am sure this will be one of the best romantic movies you'll ever see. Get ready for your heart to beat! Get ready to get goosebumps. Get ready for super chilly feelings. You're about to watch the great movie, Titanic. Enjooooy!</div>",Positive
595,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is a film that caught my emotions the very first time I saw it. It is one of the most successful movies ever made, as well as one of the most beloved. The plot describes how two young people, Rose and Jack, meet each other abroad the Atlantic ocean and fall in love. The way that this movie portrays the tragedy is so beautiful and eye catching. It is filmed with such color that the audience is just drawn to it right away. The acting is another strong point of the film. It gives the audience almost an out-of-body experience as it takes you through the plot. It is as if we are living the events on the screen: in a sense they are happening to us. The title ""Titanic"" automatically gives off a tragic tone. Everybody knows what happened on the ship. However, the many different shifts in tone make this film that much more enjoyable. It connects to the audience's emotions in such a way that they see all the different perspectives of the movie.</div>",Positive
596,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The scene were the violonists couldn't stop playing made me cry</div>",Positive
597,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I heard about this movie from my friends from a long time And today i watched it and now i can say that everyone should watch it in their lifetime once This movie does not bore you for a second and entertains you every second</div>",Positive
598,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, I'm a Star Wars fan so naturally I'm going to hate Titanic. Yep, I gave it a 1 out of 10. All I have to say is rerelease Titanic in theaters for it's 20th anniversary and we'll see if can make $130+ million dollars in that run alone, like the Star Wars Special Edition did. That will/will not have a lot to say about the long-term value of this ""epic"".</div>",Positive
599,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant film from start to finish. It's exciting, romantic, and never boring. I'm usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long, but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast. A year before this movie came out, CBS aired their two-part movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed ""unsinkable"". It was O.K., but the 1997 theatrical film made the TV version look real flat by comparison. I've always had a fascination with the Titanic disaster, and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way. When I saw this movie the first time, at times I felt like I was on the Titanic. It's that good. Splendid acting, remarkable special effects, and masterful storytelling, this is a movie that I'll never forget.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)</div>",Positive
600,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is easily the best movie ever made....surpassing all the great films of yesteryear.. Director James Cameron proves in this film just why theres only ONE James Cameron. This film is so good that I hesitate to call it a movie....Its an experience.....a VERY emotional experience...Anyone who wasnt emotionally moved by this movie must really be emotionless. Hearing Celine Dion humming the song towards the end of the movie just added to the emotion. To describe the people who hate this movie I can say this...You could give these people a brand new BMW M3 and they will find faults with it...That is what happens with a film as brilliant as this...Kate Winslet and Leonard DeCaprio are in TOP form and deliver a performace straight from heaven. I dont know how they did it but,wow this film is just something else. Thank you James Cameron for making this film and thank you to all the people who LOVE this movie....Trust me...There are lots of major fans out there of this film.</div>",Positive
601,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie make you cry,make you happy,make you proud and wake your mind up to admit this the best movie ever seen in your life.Cameron make an unforgettable movie in his career,better than Aliens and True Lies.DiCaprio and Winslet play their exciting acting and very good chemistry.No one would deny it. The special effects are great,cinematography is beautiful,art direction is outstanding,score is wow. No woman doesn't cry after see the ending. This movie was very recommended.11 Oscars and over 1,8 million dollars global gross is guarantee.Feel the movie sensation and never think you're a moviegoers if you don't say this movie was great,believe me . 10/10</div>",Positive
602,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of those films that you love to hate. But honestly there is no reason for hating this movie. Yes the movie is long, yes is commercial, yes is an ""oscar movie"" and so what?? Is a movie done with a lot of spirit, with energy, a magnificent movie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were amazing and look where they are now, they are two of the best performers of our generation and all the supporting members of the cast (Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Billy Zane... ) are respected actors that have given the world great performances. James Cameron had the vision and knew exactly who was right for the roles and in that same way he did the hole movie. The songs, the score, the make up, everything is where it belongs, is a great movie that only future generation are going to appreciate the way it should be. Is one of the most amazing shows that has ever exist in the story of the cinema. The script is good, the direction is wonderful and the hole movie is majestic. 10 / 10</div>",Positive

605,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Though ""Titanic"" didn't deserve to win best picture it is still a very well done movie that will entertain anyone who watches it. The visual effects in this film are astounding and absolutely beleivable. Alot of people say this film is overrated but I dissagree. Like I said not the best film ever but entertaining anyways. James Cameron is a masterful director and I hope he announces his next movie soon. ""Terminator 2"" still ranks as his best film though.</div>",Positive
606,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think that the fact that this movie has received so much bad talk only strengths my belief that it is an emotionally solid film with an excellent plot, sweeping love story, heart-breaking tragedy, great dialogue, and a hang on ending.  It is wonderful and romantic and fantastically played out. I AM OBSESSED WITH THE MOVIE TITANIC, I CAN RECITE ANY LINE, AND GOD DARN IT I'M PROUD OF IT!</div>",Positive

I just watched the movie.  Even though I have seen it maybe sixty times (no kidding) it still took my breath away.  Amazing, that's what it is.  I was torn to tears when Jack slipped beneath the icy black surface of the sea. Rose and Jack shared a kind of pure love we all hope to experience.  The very end was like a little taste of heaven itself, leaving me with a longing feeling to see what was next.  It was wonderful.  The love story, the tragedy, the true facts - all perfectly shown.  If you think that this movie is a flop, read some of Robert Ballard's books about his expedition to the Titanic's gravesite.  See the pictures of the debris, of the shoes where bodies once lay.  Then watch Titanic again.  I swear you will never have felt so moved in your life.</div>",Positive
609,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An awesome movie all around. And excellent fusion of the fictional with the historical. It gives a great insight of how tragic this story was and the toll of lives that were lost back in 1912. A movie like this that makes you feel like you were there even though something like this happened 90 years ago it exceptional movie making. Impossible to top, no wonder James Cameron hasn't made another movie since! The story of the vanity and the old ways of classes and how things were in the 1900's before the upheavals that took place like the Russian Revolution, WW!, WW2, etc shows how things were back then. A great and timeless movie</div>",Positive
610,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I found this movie to be absolutely wonderful! It is my number one favorite movie. All of my friends know it. Whenever i bring it up, they make fun of me. My brother and dad mock the characters for repeating Jack and Rose's names so many times. In my opinion though, they did not give this movie a chance.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful love story! The historic details in the movie are also fairly accurate. I have seen this movie many times and can quote word for word during about 85% it. That is how much i love it. I recommend it to anyone who loves 2 watch a good love story a love story.</div>",Positive
611,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This move was one if the best I have seen do far.<br/><br/>The Sound Track, The acting, The Script....everything just fitted like a jig-saw puzzle. The Outcome..?...Absolute perfection! I mean Kate Wilson acted beautifully...same goes for Leonardo DiCaprio. Their chemistry was astonishing. The directer did awesome takes of the sinking. He made it sad...Yet Horrifying..He showed us the true picture. He showed the atmosphere which was intense and hopeless. He showed it exactly what it must have been at the time of sinking. All in all...this is one of the greatest movies ever made and which I can still not forget to mention between great movies after even twenty years or so.<br/><br/>This was an unforgettable movie!! 10/10...And I don't care what people say.</div>",Positive

Thanks Jim for this masterpiece and for all of your movies and upcoming movies.Thank you</div>",Positive
613,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love this movie so much. I remember watching Titanic when I was 8 and i cried so much. James Cameron did a perfect job just seeing how much effort he put into this film is crazy. Like who has this kind of mind to think a perfect plot, relating to our history. Its just too amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was damn. Not just his looks but his acting was too perfect, his depth, his love for Rose is just every girl's dream. The other actors did amazing, Billy Zane so believable, including Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, and Kathy Bates. And of course Kate Winslet, was just so beautiful and so likable in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie shows that anyone can love, it doesn't matter what you do or who you are.</div>",Positive
614,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fantastic film it deserves all the awards that it received James Cameron at his best writing up such a fantastic film based on the true story of the wreck it shows all of the actors in this film at there finest that made them of what made them where they are today with all of the Oscars eleven of them and forty eight nominations and with the spectacular music from James Honer it is a truly and spectacular film and with a massive amount of money brought through of the box office and titanic being a highly rated film in the late nineteen nighties and came in trough until the early two thousands just after the millennium and being rated seven point seven on IMDb this truly is the best score for this film</div>",Positive
615,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best movie i have ever seen. It's my biggest love since 1997. I don't believe that some other movie will make me love it so much until i'll die !!!! I have the original movie on every type like VHS, DVD, DVD Collectors Edition, Blu-ray &amp; 3D, Xvid. The soundtrack is perfect too.</div>",Positive
616,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect</div>",Positive
617,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have no words for this epic movie can't get boor even after 20 times</div>",Positive
618,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is one of the best movies ever made, and that is proved with the record for the most money made at the box office (about 700 million). This extremely long movie stars Leo DiCaprio, who plays Jack, a poor teen with only ten dollars in his pocket, and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, a spoiled girl who's life has already been planned by her controlling mother and malicious fiancé. Jack and Rose fatefully meet aboard the 'unsinkable' Titanic on its first and last voyage in 1914. Jack saves Rose from her predictable life and teaches her that she's in control of her life, not her fiancé or her mother. Rose and Jack's romance is short-lived, as we all know what happens to the Titanic...<br/><br/>This movie is the saddest and the longest movie I've ever seen, but 3 hours spent watching it are completely worth it. Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, and when you watch the movie you can understand why.</div>",Positive
619,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My favorite movie...
i really really enjoy that and enjoy leonardo dicaprio acting.
I LOVE THAT</div>",Positive
620,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Terminator and Aliens are different from Titanic in so many ways. First of all, Terminator is, well, in simple terms, bad. Not that the movie was bad, it was just... bad. Titanic was a remarkable love story which you people obviously don't understand. Second, Terminator and Aliens are Sci-fi, and Titanic is, well, no. If you want humor, just watch the whole film in rewind.<br/><br/>This movie really made me cry. I love it so much and am looking for a Titanic desktop.<br/><br/>If you people who are romance-haters, sci-fi lovers, and just plain stinkers, I'm not having this conversation anymore.<br/><br/>Titanic was a great movie.</div>",Positive
621,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">this movie makes us all realize that things aren't what they may seem.the titanic wasn't suppose to sink, but it did.and it changed history.it also shows us that your choices affect other people. maybe not this drastically but they do affect people.the captain said full speed ahead when he knew there were ice burgs. and Jack fighting for Rose!this movie can show us that if u love somebody to keep fighting for them and don't let someone else take them away. there may be many obstacles but u can get around them. Jack told us to take life a ""deal"" at a time.and we all should take what life throws at you.this movie changes lives in more then one way: love, living, and choices!</div>",Positive
622,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film has the freedom of young people , and the humanity that people show in the face of disaster. Think carefully about the love described in this movie that transcends class and life and death.</div>",Positive
623,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's just stupid that says this movie is bad.
Titanic is one of the best films ever made, not even today there is anyone who dares to make a remake because everyone knows that there will never be a film about Titanic better than this one.</div>",Positive
624,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Still one of the best movies made. From the story to all the details. Makes me cry every time. To start in present day is genious and make it autentic even if the main characters is made up.</div>",Positive
625,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all.  Rationally, I can understand that the story was fairly ordinary, but somehow, I was riveted. This is something that I cannot explain.  For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much.  The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.  But make no mistake about it, I view this as an action film first, not as a emotional drama.  And since I view it this way, I strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance, because heart-pounding entertainment doesn't get any better than this.</div>",Positive
626,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I only went because my wife wanted to see it.  However at the end I clapped and cheered with the rest of the audience.  It was a great movie, right up there with Star Wars and Gone with the Wind.</div>",Positive
627,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Titanic is absolutely the best film I've ever seen. It has great direction (James Cameron is one of the very finest of his kind), a great script (again, thanks to Jim), but there were a few flaws of course, although less then in any other film I've seen. The acting is superb, from the main characters to the smallest supporting roles. And thanks to James Horner's music it's an even more wonderful experience. One of the best soundtracks I've heard, among the one for Schindler's List and a few others. And techically it was also a true masterpiece. THe effects are stunning, it really deserved all the technical awards it received, and all other awards too by the way. A great film with very few flaws. A 10 out of 10 from me, actually.</div>",Positive
