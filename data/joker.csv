1,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went in to joker with high expectations, and hounestly Joaquin phoenix was absolutely amazing and kept me glued to the screen, everytime arthur wore the joker make up crazy sh#t happened, joker is a really dark and sad depiction of how society really is, the past 30 minutes were the BEST piece of cinema I've seen, as soon as he put on his iconic joker make up the movie got even better, the stair dancing scene was amazing and peopel were laughing of happiness, everything from bruce Wayne's parents dying and the car dancing scene and all the followers rooting joker is without a doubt one of the BEST movies ever made and the best movie this year</div>",Negative
2,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can not understand why people think this is a good film, it's rubbish....</div>",Negative
3,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Two hours of nervous laughing, smoking and psychosis. Cigarette companies must love Hollywood. Finally extreme violence at the end. Oscar material? 10 star material? I think not. Best part the music.</div>",Negative
4,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't remember the last time I was as bored.
At no point did I give a toss about the Joker.
Beyond over rated and Joaqin Phoenix was as crap as he normally is.
Don't bother with it.</div>",Negative
5,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ugh I hate stupid movies like these so much, I don't get why or how everyone loves this movie so much. It had 0 story and a pretty stupid and cliche twist, this proves people are stupid.</div>",Negative
6,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really disappointed with this movie. It is one of the most miserable and obtuse movies I ever watched.
I wish not to waste my time watching it...</div>",Negative
7,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a very unoriginal film. just watch Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. it's basically a rip-off of those movies.</div>",Negative
8,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Good acting and all but just too negative. It's sad movie and I did not enjoy.</div>",Negative
9,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I took my kids to go see this movie and had to walk out One Hour in After Paying $50 on Tickets and Snacks!!!I thought it was going to be a movie with Batman but this has NOTHING to do with Batman!!! The theater didn't give me a refund and I'm NOT going to take my kids back in to finish it, do not watch this with your kids. I'm disappointed in DC for allowing such a movie to be made!!</div>",Negative
10,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A really bad movie, fell half a sleep during the film and the actors were really bad.</div>",Negative
11,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The worst film i have seen in my life
It is nothing</div>",Negative
12,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So first came the joker movie which was inspired by the comic with additives from King of comedy and Taxi driver.Then came the incredible box office.(If this movie deserves to make over a billion,Underwater and Charlie's Angels deserve to make 2 billion each.)But the celebration does not stop there.Hollywood loved it so much that they are giving it 11 nominations.Did they forget to give Natural born killers or The strangers, other movies that glorifies violence 11 nominations also?Because the Joker is in the same lane.You want to kill people?Just do it!You will be celebrated like a hero!Warner Brothers and everybody involved should be ashame of this piece of work.Gratious violent films should not be made and should not be rewarded.</div>",Negative
13,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is too rude to be rated as R, it should be NC-17 since it's too dangerous for non-adult</div>",Negative
14,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. Had some expectations after hype created in social media and news. But it's just so overrated. Waste of time.</div>",Negative
15,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I do not know what the fuss is about and its got a Gary Glitter song in it, I turned it off in disgust at that point..</div>",Negative
16,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't like the story of the film neither the performance of the joker</div>",Negative
17,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To be honest nothing new very simple story line ... No entertaining nor trill each and everything is terrible .. and plz don't compare this joker acting with dark night joker 😡 he was a great</div>",Negative
18,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Lame Script, absoulutely nothing special. All the hype was just a real let down. The dark knight will forever be the best joker movie ever.</div>",Negative
19,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, the cinematography was good. I can't say it was entertaining.</div>",Negative
20,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is NOT ""the best movie ever!""
It is not the worst, that title is reserved for BUG.
However, I can't see what people think even make this good.</div>",Negative
21,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Different from the others, but still relies on the comic franchise to prop it up and make it meaningful. Without the joker context, it really seems more like a documentary on severe mental health disorder. I also felt that it kind of copied a lot of aspects of fight club.</div>",Negative
22,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A depressing, boring, pile of crap. 1 is a generous rating.
Movies should be entertaining, not depressing.</div>",Negative

43,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">But the best part is joakin not film. You should watch this</div>",Negative
44,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix is a very good actor, he did all he could do to justify such a sad excuse for a story featuring as the greatest comic book villain in the universe. He did very good imitation of the many great actors who played Joker and tried to maintain the same level of insanity portrayed by them to personify the intense negative character. You could remove all the hints given in the movie to the Batman comics and Joaquin could still demand the Oscar as the best actor. But the screenplay/story destroyed all the fantasies I had, and in fact all the fans, of Joker. Joker has plan in his madness and this guy is just a regular mental patient.</div>",Negative
45,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is truely a masterpiece. Rather than a comic book flick this movie wasa total psychological study. Joaquin Phoenix was really awesome as Joker. He really made us feel compassion and sorrow for the suffering he has been facing from the dirty political society.</div>",Negative
46,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix was one of the worst jokers to ever play the part. He had 2 hours to pull you in and make you believe he could be joker but failed horribly. It was just watching some guy reading lines. Heath ledgers joker you could feel the pain in his acting. Jack Nicholson and Jared Leto you could see the crazy defiance but Phoenix was nothing. They threw the wrong guy on the screen to get across their views of the world.</div>",Negative
47,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Terrible and boring , a terrible modern movie . main character is not interesting, the movie seems like a bad copy of the first joker Movie looks like a teen movie that it is intended exclusively for teenagers because it's not too good for adults ,it is too soft .I give a review 2 of 10 And the movie is boring and not interesting at least deserves 2 for a nice picture</div>",Negative
48,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't get all the 10 scores for this movie. I found it to be a confusing, convoluted mess, not worth the money I paid to see it, oh wait I did not pay to see it so that is a plus. Slow, boring and full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through. If you go into this movie thinking it is an extension of the Christopher Nolan trilogy, you are in for a rude awakening. If you think that this is the Joker of the 1960s Batman, you are in for shock. Hard pass.</div>",Negative
49,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Way too long for what was told. Way too slow. The hype is ""fake"". The acting is good along with the cenematography, but the plot and story doesn't need more than an hour to tell. Can not agree with this movie winning an oscar for any category.</div>",Negative
50,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Could have been good. I don't understand why anyone would rate this well unless you like watching a depressed person for 2hrs. Was expecting a decent movie with the ratings. Must be some Emmy award-winning garbage.</div>",Negative
51,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finally got around to watching this movie, I really enjoy a good origin story of which this was not! The maniacal clown that I grew up with reading the comics Was this, he was originally the Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name ""Joker"", from the playing card figure he came to resemble.
He was not a young Jack Napier who killed Bruce Wayne's parents in the Tim Burton travesty. He didn't start a clown movement and start a riot resulting in Wayne's parents death. Let's do a little time line figuring out too. If Arthur was lets say 30 in this movie and Bruce was lets say 10, when the time came for the two to meet as The Joker and Batman the would have been 50 and 30.
Enough with destroying characters origins!</div>",Negative
52,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an absolute horrible slog of a film. It is dark, depressing, poorly acted, incredibly and needlessly violent and the very antithesis of entertainment. Avoid this absysmal piece of dung.</div>",Negative
53,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I guess I was expecting something more, the hype was huge, sadly I felt this movie left me wondering why?? The acting was adequate, action non existent, dialogue superficial and Phoenix a sad reproduction of Ledgers benchmark. Just my opinion, however my lady watched it with me and seemed befuddled by the absolute lack of anything noteworthy. As an origin story, it was disappointing, as an artistic endeavor to exploit comic logic in an ethereal manner, it was tragically successful. Of the 20 or so people I have discussed this movie with, all but one, an arts student in his eighth year of studies, felt much the same. Sadly, this seems to be the way of the Hollywood studios, reheat old stew, add curry powder and call it original.</div>",Negative
54,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a waste of money on a bad movie, apart from Joaquin the movie sucks, way too boring way too long, have no idea how this piece of crap got over 8 on score.... the movie deserves 0.1 and not even 1 but I gave 2 thanks to the main actor..</div>",Negative
55,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You'll see him dance a lot, it's a funny dance. He'll do some acting too.
Sometimes they slow down the shots, actually they do this quite a bit, to music.
It's also got a really nasty message.
Which could've easily been a good message.
But the director made sure we all knew his intentions.</div>",Negative
56,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Possibly the most overrated film I've seen in a longtime. I thought Joaquin Phoenix wasn't nearly as good as Jack Nicholson's or Heath Ledgers. It took too long to get to the Joker part and then he wasn't nearly as creepy as either Ledger or Nicholsons. I wasn't impressed.</div>",Negative
57,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you love, care for, help, or just walked passed someone that struggles with mental health issues this movie spits in their face. This IS NOT The Joker. The Joker is fully aware, and loves every ounce of chaos he causes, this steaming pile of garbage takes any and all responsibility for what The Joker does and drops the blame square on the shoulders of mental health struggles he inherited from his mother, and pushed to the extreme by society. Every single criticism, or controversial review of this movie is completely justified. Oh, for Batman fans, Todd Phillips turned Thomas Wayne into Donald Trump.</div>",Negative
58,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film and birdman are two movies that stand out in my mind as time I will never get back.Take early Scorsese and add a dash of American psycho then slow the pace to 10% and you get somewhere close to this movie.After watching Joaquin Phoenix Oscar acceptance speech, I don't think he was acting in ""joker"",I think he was just an extreme version of himself.My wife and I kept waiting for this film to take off but got so frustrated we eventually fast forwarded through it.</div>",Negative
59,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film clearly polarises its viewers and I'm afraid I'm in the minority end of that polarisation. It is an over-long self indulgent study of mental illness, which is bizarrely set in a comic book world where we see the groundwork for a future Batman. A very unentertaining couple of hours, although I do acknowledge Phoenix's performance - which became the first time two actors have won an Oscar for playing the same character (Heath Ledger won for his Joker).</div>",Negative
60,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So the movie is about a scumbag, that shows you how he became a scumbag. It gets credited for relating to how the scumbags mental state is, and how he managed to become this lowlife scumbag. Somehow this scumbags life is relatable to some people because his weak mindedness allows him to be a sociopath. So what begs to differ is - is the person that wrote the script for this movie a sociopath, or are the people that believe this is a great movie are sociopaths!!! I know one thing is for sure, I'd prefer to sleep in a room with people that think this movie is morally wrong!!!</div>",Negative
61,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Turned it off after 15 minutes. Joaquin Phoenix can't act anymore, it's the same character every time I see him since his weird hiatus. How this movie has so much credit is beyond me, maybe it's the co stars or they haven't seen Joaquin act before.</div>",Negative
62,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boring, overrated &amp; a stupid movie. Waste of time.</div>",Negative
63,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is way too boring, way too long, nothing exciting happened, the movie generally sucks apart from the joker himself which Joaquin played really well and the rest deserve 0.1 out of 10..... such a waste of money to buy the Blu-ray :/</div>",Negative
64,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Actor quality aside. This is just a sad story contrived to be sad without merit for story telling. It happened exactly as you could imagine without any creativity on the writers side.<br/><br/>Rather than watch this I suggest rewatching V for Vendetta, it's the same story done 100x better.</div>",Negative
65,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Extremely overrated i see all the reviews above 8 . I want to watxh, when i watched i disappointed</div>",Negative

87,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?</div>",Negative
88,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing.</div>",Negative
89,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end.</div>",Negative
90,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?<br/><br/>This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!<br/><br/>The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film.</div>",Negative
91,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie</div>",Negative
92,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!</div>",Negative
93,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.<br/><br/>The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.</div>",Negative
94,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness</div>",Negative
95,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.</div>",Negative
96,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie</div>",Negative
97,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is a shallow look at mental disorders, and somehow is 2 hours but moves in no direction and drops you back to the beginning. Do not waste your money, go see Hustlers.</div>",Negative
98,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is no reason for this movie to have been made. I went because of all the ecstatic reviews. Two hours of relentless blood spilling and gory murders. Giving the Joker this horrific backstory does nothing to enhance the Batman nemesis story. Joaquin Phoenix gives a silly, over-the-top performance. Robert De Nero is the only reason I gave this trash 3 stars. He enhances, but cannot save, this terrible movie.</div>",Negative
99,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic.</div>",Negative
100,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think this is a movie for Batman or comic fans?
As a stand-alone movie I didn't really care for it.
Nothing really happened, a guy was sad and depressed and killed another guy.
Nothing impressive</div>",Negative
101,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character.</div>",Negative
102,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In terms of production this film is on the A lost, however, I failed to draw any entertainment or value from this movie. Dont recommend it at all.</div>",Negative
103,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role</div>",Negative
104,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning.</div>",Negative
105,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life.</div>",Negative
106,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Feels a bit like Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver, but not nearly as good as either. Was there a single memorable script line or cerebral plot twist in the entire film? Not that I noticed.</div>",Negative
107,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I dislike this movie, although I do not deny the great performance of Joaquin Phoenix. I extremely dislike the ways to send the genuine message about mental illness: unrealistically ugly graffiti everywhere on/in the bus and buildings, unreasonable intensified music here and there, over-centered crime scenes, unrealistic incapable/stupid police, weird development of psychiatric disorders, unbelievable reaction of the society to the crime behaviors... all of them make me extremely uncomfortable rather than enjoying the show.</div>",Negative
108,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow. I can't believe what I watched. Not in a good way. Although the filmmakers said this was ""king of comedy"" or ""taxi driver"" it most certainly is not. Sorry to be saying this. I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver. There were a lot of topics touched on (race, poverty, mental health, comedy) that never really felt like they hit a real point of view.</div>",Negative
109,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not as good as i thought, too much overrated by people</div>",Negative
110,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a waste of time for me at least. I felt like I had seen it all before, on TV, you know one of those soap operas. Not sure how it's been ranked so high, I guess some just like snail paced movies where it's all about the sad upbringing of the main character.
Beware, this is not a DC movie, more like a telenovela.</div>",Negative
111,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bleak, rarely entertaining, unoriginal, didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it all a dream in the end? When the lights came on in the cinema you could sense the disappointment in the audience. Stony silence. Wish I trusted my gut and didn't go. Just re-watch Heath Ledger's Joker again, honestly. At least it tries to balance art with entertainment, and doesn't just sink into the depths of pretentiousness. Phoenix does his best, but between this and: You were never really here, he needs to lighten it up a bit. Commodus in Gladiator was more interesting and well rounded.</div>",Negative
112,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Huge disappointment. Another way over hyped release from Hollywood. Actors acting crazy isn't hard for them. While a lot of people give Joaquin Phoenix huge rave reviews, looking at the performance with a deeper critical view reveals just a deeper level of crazy. You'd have to pay me to watch this one again. Story line was also very weak and the movie puts all of its eggs into the one basket of Joaquin Phoenix. Hollywood continues to try to outdo the previous versions of a character that by now is long worn out.</div>",Negative
113,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like Movies with Zero Story and 2 Hours of bla bla nonsense, this is for you!<br/><br/>This was by far the most boring Movie of 2019. An yeah, normally i Like the Joker, but what was that?
Sure i understand the Story about isolation and the Psychological Side.
But what makes this a Movie so special that it deserves a 8.8 Score?
Because of the Laughs from Joker? Because he shots some People?<br/><br/>The Acting, sure was top notch, and the cinematography was wonderful.
But aside that, we have nothing remarkable. Only the Joker had a Character developement. All other Characters are boring sterotypes with not a single sidestory.<br/><br/>3 Stars because of Acting and Cinematography... Nothing more.</div>",Negative
114,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You people are just as delusional as Arthur fleck this is not a good movie at all just bad</div>",Negative
115,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The dark path is essentially the entire plot of the movie. In no way does this Joker pull himself together to be the devious plotter that the character is supposed to be. The artistry is good, but Joaquin's depiction looks more like bad acting than awkward social skills. Remember, Joker is supposed to be a master manipulator. He looks fantastic as Joker, but the mannerisms just aren't quite right. At least it's better than Jared Leto's depiction.</div>",Negative
116,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didnt find it exciting at all.
Bad and shallow story</div>",Negative
117,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie has some of the best acting I have ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix made a statement for the acting GOAT however the movie had one of the thinnest plots of any movie I have ever seen &amp; it felt like the movie was made as an after thought to someone who wanted to make a statement about Mental Illness.</div>",Negative
118,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Film doesn't deserve it's age recommendation, it's heavily brutal and bloody.<br/><br/>The story itself is very flat, not much deeper then about a person who has to laugh when feeling bad/sad.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it's really well played. The actors are damn good, sound editing, cut, ... really good artists there :)</div>",Negative
119,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is nobody and nothing in this movie to sympathize with, it's boring and utterly nihilistic. Also, many scenes and characters simply do not make sense and only exist so the story can go forward. For example the Trump-like millionaire figure Wayne calling all ordinary people ""jokers"" on TV in a comically condescending way. Or three good-looking white Wall Street guys in suits bullying a woman on the subway and beating up the Joker for intervening.<br/><br/>It's just all so stupid. Don't bother.</div>",Negative
120,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was hard to follow. It was all over the place.</div>",Negative
121,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""If everyone in a room is thinking all the same, someone is not thinking."" George S.Patton. Last night I watched dear Heath run his dance as Joker and wonderment of it all - how damn good he was. So tonight I walked into a brick wall. EVERYONE says magnificent. Better than CITIZEN KANE and such tripe. Me? Bored, after 20 min of just bleak - nothing positive. I am moving right now and that is enough stress so I wanted entertainment - and WHOA was this one off base. Walked out after 20 min and I don't care a damn what happened to Joker. Penguin would be more interesting by a yard mile. I am sorry folks - disagree with all of you. Piece of junk.</div>",Negative
122,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very poor story line, Just goes to show the power of the hype train.
JP acted brilliantly, but one performance cannot carry the whole film.</div>",Negative
123,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I fell for the hype which I usually treat with scepticism. An hour in and I was itching to walk out. I stuck it out but that was a mistake. I give it 3 stars because Phoenix is very good. It is a depressing movie with no real plot other than a studio version of an art house ""descent into madness"". There's a tenuous link to Batman and an ending that leaves the door open for a sequel which I will avoid like the plague.
Save your money and avoid this one too!!</div>",Negative
124,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a complete waste of time. 2 hours of watching a man with a mental disability get beaten around in a desperate attempt by the director to allay pity towards the lead anti-hero.<br/><br/>Added to the 'Not worth torrenting ' list</div>",Negative
125,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've tried. I really did, but it's boring. It's contrived. It tries just too hard. I'm not sure what others who have rated this so highly see as perfection, but this just ain't it. It's a sad boring movie that usurped a know character and tried to make it relevant by making it look like a movie I watched on Saturday afternoon on TBS at my grandmother's house.
Phoenix.... I don't know what he's supposed to be doing. DeNiro has become just as pointless and abstract as one of his father's inane doodles.
It's just not a good movie.</div>",Negative
126,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really expected more from it. Character development was great, but when it got interesting the film ended. Quite disappointing</div>",Negative
127,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting is great but the movie is not. I have difficulty understanding the point of this movie. 2+ hours of self pity? How did this movie make a billion? There's no story. No character development. Really fell flat for me. Highly disappointed after all of the hype.</div>",Negative
128,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was pretty boring. Very tough to stay awake.</div>",Negative
129,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I gave it 3 just to even out the score some. If you want to see a mentally challenged man get beat up and abused and then bait people into doing it to him so that he can then murder them, this is the movie for you...<br/><br/>Character development is painfully slow and awkward. If you're a weirdo or use a gender pronoun other than male or female, this movie is probably right up your alley.</div>",Negative
130,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched the movie yesterday. I am from India and we get to see these characters on daily basis in different forms. For us, its similar to an Art movie. Few people like these because of individual performances but majority will hate as there is almost nothing to watch except seeing a guy turning insane. Save your money and time and watch any light hearted movie.</div>",Negative
131,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am the kind of person who enjoys a good anti-hero now and then. But Joker took it to another level, they overly glorified violence, mental illness.
The worst part of the movie was Phoenix. He is completely unbelievable as the Joker (a supervillian, remember). He overacts the whole movie, and you just lose sympathy for the character since it is so overdone.
Overall a bad movie, keeping in the context that this is supposed to be a ""superhero"" type movie. Might be an ok art-house type movie, but the fact that they tried this with comic book characters just ruins the whole thing.
The only good part of the movie is DeNiro, he does a great job in his role. Easily stole the show for his scenes.</div>",Negative
132,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So this Joker character has nothing to do with the DCEU's Joker, the name and the Waynes and Gotham city is just added as a cheap shot to sell this no-so-good drama. And apparently it works, if you can believe the IMDb score. Probably because people go to a DCEU movie and instead they see two hours of whimpering that the rich are so evil and the government doesn't care about us and that's what sells these days.</div>",Negative
133,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bad bad and boring movie.<br/><br/>dont get the hype bc this was one hell of a slow and bad movie</div>",Negative
134,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Call this movie ""the story of A. Fleck"" instead of ""Joker"" and you'll get a story of a mind disabled guy dismissed by the society which will not be concerned to nobody (either the character nor the movie).</div>",Negative
135,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautifully lit. But my god was it boring as hell.</div>",Negative
136,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nice experience at the cinema. Interesting ideas presented. Stars for the amazing performance by Mr. Phoenix. Mostly it felt too depressing and downright anxiety inducing.</div>",Negative
137,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie and was unable to understand what was so special about this movie. Except acting of one actor nothing was so special. Rather movie was depressing and at certain times was irritating. Hats off to people who have made this movie a hype and hit. I am sure when hype will be over the rating will go down</div>",Negative
138,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The disappointment of the year. The story is empty, without a clear purpose. In depth characterization doesn't make a movie by itself. It's boring as hell.</div>",Negative
139,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am disappointed and bored! Is not what I expected! Even I prefer DC more than Marvel they should could done it better!</div>",Negative
140,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first hour and half of this movie was so boring that I almost left. The action started at the end when finally the Joker is presented in a show.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed</div>",Negative
141,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Smoking and laughing are the two main things failed the film.</div>",Negative
142,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is so bad; like incredibly bad. There is no plot other than the pity-party of a troubled man. Nothing exists beyond this in the form of character development: past, present, or future. Not even supporting characters provide relief. You can tell they just wanted to point a camera at an actor and tell them to act distressed and estranged then go home and call it art/film. The final straw was the fact that the Joker I have known is cunning and plans elaborate schemes. This ""joker"" could not even plan what is for dinner. He is just along for the ride and 180° from the true character. They could not have missed the mark more.</div>",Negative
143,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Was bored through a lot of this. Anyone saying this is a ""masterpiece"" is just jumping on a band wagon. Rename it ""Arthur"" and remove a couple of references to Arkham and the Wayne family and no-one would say that it is in the Batman world... also very few people would have gone to see it.</div>",Negative
144,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I found this movie as slow drama, the funny parts are: the dwarf cant reach the lock on the door to leave, and the ending, where he is interviewed by Maury. Other than that, this isn't a real edge of your seat action film. The movie is mostly a prologue to joker before batman. It would be interesting to see a better film come out of this, with LOTS of action with joker being Diabolical!</div>",Negative
145,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting was great but Oscar movies are a mess. They drag you only for the acting. And talking. And crying. I was expecting more of a vilan than 12 monkey kind of a movie. I almost felt asleep 3 times. Not worth my money at the theater. Like I said, acting is good but the movie drags itself and storyline was not brought well. My first review but I am a movieholic so this is not the first movie I watched</div>",Negative
146,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">2 hours of movie with about 10 minutes of interest. The Joker is a study in how to take a beloved icon and turn him into a pathetic loser that no one cares about. This Joker isn't a clown prince of crime, he's a failed clown who is terrible at his job, terrible at life and needs to be medicated to prevent delusions of competency. Sure there is a subtext of how society is fails those who need mental help, but that theme is buried under the 'eat the rich' theme where the man trying to help pull the city out of a rut is demonized.
Frankly this movie is little more than an exercise in 'woe is me'-ism and not worth the time needed to watch it.</div>",Negative
147,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix acting was brilliant but the movie is disturbing. A slow movie</div>",Negative
148,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Although Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job, this backstory trip into the pathos of the Joker could have been achieved equally as well with a few lines in another movie. It's incredibly predictable. I am one who doesn't mind a slow brewing movie as long as there's a point to it, which this movie achieved in its first slow closeup. Every one after that was like, ""here, you want some more slow? How about an extra serving of maudlin? Would you like some whine with that?""</div>",Negative
149,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boring movie, was hoping it would end sooner than it did.<br/><br/>The movie is purely about Joaquin Phoenix.</div>",Negative
150,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ages 12-35 will love this movie. Like seemingly every other character study in Hollywood, it exaggerates the impact of poor parenting and bullying to appeal to the masses who feel a certain way about how poorly their life has gone. The movie wanted to be realistic and gritty, but it wasn't. If just one person could show me where all of these 30 year olds who are getting bullied for doing their jobs are, maybe it would validate some of the ridiculousness.
Using a famous character unnecessarily to make this movie is another issue I took. Creativity is lacking though, and money must be made, so I digress.
The pacing was decent, but the first 1.5 hours were almost too boring to stay awake though. The redeeming quality was the acting, though not ""Oscar worthy"". Phoenix almost always turns in a good performance as one of the more versatile actors.</div>",Negative
151,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't know what all these reviews are about, it's a masterpiece etc etc it's really not! I fell asleep half way through and woke up purposely to see the ending which still didn't do anything for me!<br/><br/>Bore off!!! Let's hope the sequel isn't as dry and plotless as this was!</div>",Negative
152,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I tried to watch this movie. 35 minutes in I was ready to turn it off. I lasted an hour. What garbage.</div>",Negative
153,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Whilst Joaquin Phoenix shines as the Joker this movie was an extremely blasphemous telling of his story. Rating the movie as a tragic tale of a tortured soul driven to the breaking point I'd rate it 7 out of 10. But as the origin story of the Joker I'd rate as being on the waiting list to get to 0. So many things that just are blasphemous to the Batman universe and to the history of the Joker. I can't.</div>",Negative
154,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Overhyped film, really slow, predictable, low budget, hardly any fight scenes. Didn't enjoy it in the cinema and almost fell asleep. Would of got up and walked out for a refund if I was on my own. Heath ledgers performance as the joker was more believable, scary and funny.<br/><br/>This joker film isn't funny and I didn't laugh once. It's a low budget cash grab, with an actor who cant laugh properly and someone who clearly wasnt invested in his role and was clearly after the pay cheque. No wonder he has not been so active in movies for years. He is so unlikeable.<br/><br/>Joker is simply overhyped.</div>",Negative
155,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting was brilliant. The story line was crap. The movies was strange and dragged on. Dont know what the hype was all about. Definitely not movie of the year.</div>",Negative
156,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very negative movie with great acting ? No , it doesn't bring join to me at all. Why should it ? Life is beautiful. If you find this movie attractive,then you have a depressing life.</div>",Negative
157,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know this not a comedy movie or a action movie but it was so boring the story was not interesting at all not a single moment of feeling attached to this movie,,how this movie become movie of the year....of course lot of money spend on promotion which make an psychological effect on the peoples mind that this is the best movie.</div>",Negative
158,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This story is so obnoxious and uninteresting. The worst fast and the furious is better.</div>",Negative
159,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a dark disappointment. Found it quite boring, wish I hadn't watched the whole movie. Movies like this getting so many 10's make me think someone has figured out how to submit 100's of reviews to skew results.</div>",Negative
160,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know many people who saw this and most said I should see it and that I would enjoy it so I went into this with an open mind. I did get a little interesting about 20 tp 30 minutes before the end. But this is far from a good movie. I am not sure how it has gotten such a high rating. I am glad I did not pay to see this, as I would have wanted my $$$ back.</div>",Negative
161,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have watched all movies of DC and obviously a great DC fan.
Yesterday only I watched the movie and after watching this hole 2 hr movie, I was feeling like I am a psychic, weird stuffs were coming in my mind and my friends too.
At the end I must say it's a worst movie.</div>",Negative
162,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After 30 minutes I was thinking ""dear, God, make it end.""
Extremely slow to start and didn't find it as good as people claimed and not worth my money.
Only decent thing about it was the Joker laugh.</div>",Negative
163,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Today's Hollywood simply wants to make Nutjobs look like they can become anti-heroes.
I simply hated it, as another DC crappy movie of Darkness that just falls in line with the TV show Gothem, which is awful as well.
So far, the only DC Movies that I have thoroughly enjoyed is Wonder Woman, and I've enjoyed the Recent Batman Movies.
Superman sucked and so does this Gothem crap!</div>",Negative
164,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Remember ""Avatar"" the movie everyone watched thinking it was about the 4 element master Aang. Well, this movie it's the same. Out of context of superheroes. Just a famous name to get the public</div>",Negative
165,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like the cinematography, their choice of actors and the main and sub plot but two hours is far too long. It could have been shorter. For half the movie, I was asleep because there was no actual thing going on in the movie. I didn't know if his was imagination or an actual scene and that made it less entertaining to watch. I just did not like it.</div>",Negative
166,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbelievably boring. Can't say anything else. Forced myself to stay awake, waiting for the moment the movie would become interesting..... then saw ""the end""</div>",Negative
167,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie would have been 3.3 times better if it had no DC or Batman references. Long drawn out scenes, tedious dialogue and a poor version of The Joker character (NOT the acting).</div>",Negative
168,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ridiculous hype and praise for this movie is mind numbing. The plot is flimsy at best. As I read these reviews for this movie touting the film as one of the greatest ever, I almost think people just want to be in the I loved Joker club (so they can pretend they are somehow more enlightened that they can enjoy such a deep story and powerful message). I realize that not all good movies are necessary to see twice but I'd rather do just about anything than sit through 2 more hours of this flick.</div>",Negative
169,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was expecting a great movie after great reviews, however, it was hard not to fall sleep...awfull, lousy acting from Phoenix, lame story. Too violent and bloody, full of slow and meaningless scenes.
Not the best performance of Phoenix, can't understand good reviews for this empty film- full of nonsense.His character is not deep enough, overacted, predictible and boring most of the times.
The end was the worst, I was expecting more so stayed until the end. Heath Ledger rocks Phoenix SUCKED here.
D I S S A P O I N T I NG.</div>",Negative
170,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was junk. Super slow And uneventful throughout. You will fall asleep if you don't drink 5 cups of coffee it's that dull</div>",Negative
171,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie itself didn't have what it takes to be a psychodrama movie! I didn't like the directing nor the storyline even sometimes the lead actor performance was exaggerated. Couldn't help but think.. maybe after a couple of years another movie will be out better than this. I loved Joaquin Phoenix performance real talent simply amazing</div>",Negative
172,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is no action. It is very dark and a very dragging story telling.</div>",Negative
173,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a terrible hodgepodge of previous movies. The camera following Joker through the corridors and on stage is directly from Birdman where the director is a wannabe Inarritu. Joaquin Phoenix who has acted in Quills along-with Geoffrey Rush tried to imitate Rush but failed miserably. The stairs scene and the death of ailing mother along-with mother-son relationship and the apartment was a ditto copy of 1973 Exorcist.

175,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Terrible movie, do not understand the hype. Very little about this movie was redeemable. Boring, pointless, and just so very awful.

176,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would have loved to see The Joker, but that washed-up lunatic Robert DeNiro is in it!
His presence ruins the movie for me. Seeing him makes me want to punch him in the face!
There are literaly hundreds of capable actors who could have played his part.
Why in this Great America of ours would any studio hire a washed-up lunatic like DeNiro in what would otherwise be a great film?!</div>",Negative

178,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a terrible hodgepodge of previous movies. The camera following Joker through the corridors and on stage is directly from Birdman where the director is a wannabe Inarritu. Joaquin Phoenix who has acted in Quills along-with Geoffrey Rush tried to imitate Rush but failed miserably. The stairs scene and the death of ailing mother along-with mother-son relationship and the apartment was a ditto copy of 1973 Exorcist. Other copycat scenes from Taxi Driver, Network, Shining (toilet father-son episode), etc. Tod Philips might have earned a lot of money but it was an appalling reproduction of previous movies.</div>",Negative

180,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is no action. It is very dark and a very dragging story telling.</div>",Negative
181,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie itself didn't have what it takes to be a psychodrama movie! I didn't like the directing nor the storyline even sometimes the lead actor performance was exaggerated. Couldn't help but think.. maybe after a couple of years another movie will be out better than this. I loved Joaquin Phoenix performance real talent simply amazing</div>",Negative
182,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was junk. Super slow And uneventful throughout. You will fall asleep if you don't drink 5 cups of coffee it's that dull</div>",Negative
183,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was expecting a great movie after great reviews, however, it was hard not to fall sleep...awfull, lousy acting from Phoenix, lame story. Too violent and bloody, full of slow and meaningless scenes.
Not the best performance of Phoenix, can't understand good reviews for this empty film- full of nonsense.His character is not deep enough, overacted, predictible and boring most of the times.
The end was the worst, I was expecting more so stayed until the end. Heath Ledger rocks Phoenix SUCKED here.
D I S S A P O I N T I NG.</div>",Negative
184,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie would have been 3.3 times better if it had no DC or Batman references. Long drawn out scenes, tedious dialogue and a poor version of The Joker character (NOT the acting).</div>",Negative
185,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ridiculous hype and praise for this movie is mind numbing. The plot is flimsy at best. As I read these reviews for this movie touting the film as one of the greatest ever, I almost think people just want to be in the I loved Joker club (so they can pretend they are somehow more enlightened that they can enjoy such a deep story and powerful message). I realize that not all good movies are necessary to see twice but I'd rather do just about anything than sit through 2 more hours of this flick.</div>",Negative
186,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbelievably boring. Can't say anything else. Forced myself to stay awake, waiting for the moment the movie would become interesting..... then saw ""the end""</div>",Negative
187,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like the cinematography, their choice of actors and the main and sub plot but two hours is far too long. It could have been shorter. For half the movie, I was asleep because there was no actual thing going on in the movie. I didn't know if his was imagination or an actual scene and that made it less entertaining to watch. I just did not like it.</div>",Negative
188,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Remember ""Avatar"" the movie everyone watched thinking it was about the 4 element master Aang. Well, this movie it's the same. Out of context of superheroes. Just a famous name to get the public</div>",Negative
189,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Today's Hollywood simply wants to make Nutjobs look like they can become anti-heroes.
I simply hated it, as another DC crappy movie of Darkness that just falls in line with the TV show Gothem, which is awful as well.
So far, the only DC Movies that I have thoroughly enjoyed is Wonder Woman, and I've enjoyed the Recent Batman Movies.
Superman sucked and so does this Gothem crap!</div>",Negative
190,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know many people who saw this and most said I should see it and that I would enjoy it so I went into this with an open mind. I did get a little interesting about 20 tp 30 minutes before the end. But this is far from a good movie. I am not sure how it has gotten such a high rating. I am glad I did not pay to see this, as I would have wanted my $$$ back.</div>",Negative
191,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have watched all movies of DC and obviously a great DC fan.
Yesterday only I watched the movie and after watching this hole 2 hr movie, I was feeling like I am a psychic, weird stuffs were coming in my mind and my friends too.
At the end I must say it's a worst movie.</div>",Negative
192,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After 30 minutes I was thinking ""dear, God, make it end.""
Extremely slow to start and didn't find it as good as people claimed and not worth my money.
Only decent thing about it was the Joker laugh.</div>",Negative
193,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting was brilliant. The story line was crap. The movies was strange and dragged on. Dont know what the hype was all about. Definitely not movie of the year.</div>",Negative
194,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very negative movie with great acting ? No , it doesn't bring join to me at all. Why should it ? Life is beautiful. If you find this movie attractive,then you have a depressing life.</div>",Negative
195,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know this not a comedy movie or a action movie but it was so boring the story was not interesting at all not a single moment of feeling attached to this movie,,how this movie become movie of the year....of course lot of money spend on promotion which make an psychological effect on the peoples mind that this is the best movie.</div>",Negative
196,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This story is so obnoxious and uninteresting. The worst fast and the furious is better.</div>",Negative
197,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a dark disappointment. Found it quite boring, wish I hadn't watched the whole movie. Movies like this getting so many 10's make me think someone has figured out how to submit 100's of reviews to skew results.</div>",Negative
198,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Whilst Joaquin Phoenix shines as the Joker this movie was an extremely blasphemous telling of his story. Rating the movie as a tragic tale of a tortured soul driven to the breaking point I'd rate it 7 out of 10. But as the origin story of the Joker I'd rate as being on the waiting list to get to 0. So many things that just are blasphemous to the Batman universe and to the history of the Joker. I can't.</div>",Negative
199,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Overhyped film, really slow, predictable, low budget, hardly any fight scenes. Didn't enjoy it in the cinema and almost fell asleep. Would of got up and walked out for a refund if I was on my own. Heath ledgers performance as the joker was more believable, scary and funny.<br/><br/>This joker film isn't funny and I didn't laugh once. It's a low budget cash grab, with an actor who cant laugh properly and someone who clearly wasnt invested in his role and was clearly after the pay cheque. No wonder he has not been so active in movies for years. He is so unlikeable.<br/><br/>Joker is simply overhyped.</div>",Negative
200,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't know what all these reviews are about, it's a masterpiece etc etc it's really not! I fell asleep half way through and woke up purposely to see the ending which still didn't do anything for me!<br/><br/>Bore off!!! Let's hope the sequel isn't as dry and plotless as this was!</div>",Negative
201,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went to see this last night and I have to say I was really looking forward to it, when I came out of the cinema all I could think is why the hell did I want to go see that so much!!<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Joker but thats pretty much the only positive I can say about this.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours long and I can honestly say I was totally bored for the first 90 minutes, the last half hour is better but not by much. I found myself looking at my watch thinking when is it going to start, where is the gruesome violence that apparently makes people leave the cinema, in short it's not really there, I think they were leaving because they were bored.</div>",Negative
202,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????</div>",Negative
203,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Is it just me or does anyone over 30 see they kind of ripped off ""the King of Comedy (1982)""?</div>",Negative
204,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline
Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing
Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing</div>",Negative
205,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A mentally ill person without talents (or intelligence) cannot become a super villain just because he is angry. He will only be a mentally ill person with no talents (and intelligence) in anger. Nothing more. As a film, Joker lacks creativity or depth. In all senses. Unfortunately Joker did for the iconical character the same thing that Twilight did for vampire films.</div>",Negative
206,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know I really wanted to like this film, but to me the plot was a let down and Joaquin Phoenix's performance while good didn't quite match the hype. It had great production, the cinematography, sound production and editing were all good.
I didn't buy into this character becoming a criminal mastermind, there was no hint of this guy having the intelligence the Joker is known, there was no plan to his actions, just reaction to his situation, unhinged reaction but nothing more. And there was no wacky monologues the Joker is know for, not it even a hint of it.
I was going to say it left me wanting more but no, I can't see me giving this incarnation of the joker anymore of my time.</div>",Negative
207,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor.</div>",Negative
208,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?</div>",Negative
209,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly people who have rated this movie as a ""masterpiece"" need to start watching some actual masterpieces. Predictable over indulgent and simplistic (not in a good way). You could see every ""climax"" 10 mins before it happens. Good things and why I have it 4. 1.Score 2.Cinematography 3.Art direction 4.Music choice<br/><br/>Film makers need to start making some good films!</div>",Negative
210,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is just so sad. I felt uncomfortable, sad and depressed the entire time. Is that what the movie was supposed to do? Yea sure. But I left the movie theatre with such a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach and I cried for about an hour. It is two hours that will make you feel awful and sad, but the ending is kinda cool.</div>",Negative
211,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!</div>",Negative
212,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Take Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (and maybe a touch of Falling Down), mash them together with only a basic idea of what made those movies good, and use a popular comic book villain as the lead in order to get far more recognition for the film than it would have gotten otherwise and you have Joker.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix may have acted the hell out of the title role, but it doesn't change the fact that Joker is at best a pale imitation of far better films that actually knew how to make a point with their social commentary.<br/><br/>Phoenix's performance and the cursory Scorsese like visual aesthetic may have tricked others into seeing depth where there isn't any... but not me. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one.</div>",Negative
213,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is first movie I watched and review on this site. Well, watch this movie if you have absolutely little else to do. I found it very boring, longish, and at the end of the movie in theatre I was about to fall asleep. This boring it was. I mean people, you better entertain yourself watching washing machine going, two hours straight. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is just boring as hell.</div>",Negative
214,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was so sad after watching the movie because I had such high expectations. I absolutely love Joker in the Batman movies, in the cartoon, even in suicide squad. Joaquins acting is outstanding, but the movie is nothing like I expected. 75% of the movie portrays how depressing his life is, which made the movie feel like it was going on forever. It was unnecessary. The last 15-20 minutes was really good, because that's when the action started coming in.<br/><br/>For more fancy movie watchers it may be a masterpiece, but for a simple Batman fan it was just boring.</div>",Negative
215,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie has already been done, and much more successfully. 'Nightcrawler' set the standard for lonely-sociopath-craves-recognition movies and 'Joker' comes nowhere near its impact.
While 'Nightcrawler' avoids creating any sort of sympathy for the character, 'Joker' dares us NOT to feel sorry for him. It can't (or won't) go the extra mile and simply create a character with no redeeming features, which is exactly what the Joker should be. Instead, it insists on pulling at our heart strings by filling the first half of the movie with endless scenes of sorrow and misery for the character.
It is nothing more than a sugar-coated vision by the director, and Phoenix, while doing admirable work with what little he was given,just comes across as pathetic and haphazard. Almost like each scene was created on the spot.</div>",Negative
216,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really can not see what the fuss was about with this movie, especially compared to some movies which are only receiving 5 or 6 stars 😂</div>",Negative
217,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Slow, pointless &amp; a waste of time.. the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time. How did it possibly have to take so long to tell the audience he's mentally unwell &amp; how surprising it was due to his mother, really?! As imaginative as a white sock.
Some nice camera work but otherwise over hyped rubbish. Heath Ledgers Joker was a thousand times better.</div>",Negative
218,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought this movie was so boring! I kept hearing from people how good it was so I never expected it to be so dull. The last 15 to 20 minutes were riveting but didn't make up for the snooze fest that happened before.
I also feel like I've seen the Joaquin performance so many times before. The actor who loses a bunch of weight and dances in his underwear. It's been done. Let's see something different!
I know this is an unpopular opinion but I just thought I would share my differing view of the film.</div>",Negative
219,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not sure this is the masterpiece everyone is raving about. It's all a bit predictable and samey.<br/><br/>There's no creativity... a copy script of king of comedy and copying the character of taxi driver.
As for Joaquin Phoenix, I don't know why it's an amazing performance. He lost some weight, danced, laughed, pulled some silly faces and really just played it like I expected him too... No killer scenes or memorable lines, nothing out of the ordinary or surprising.<br/><br/>It's not a film you'll watch again, unlike other joker performances, quite dull and boring throughout waiting for a big scene which never delivers. I left just not really feeling anything for it... hmmm yh it was alright.</div>",Negative
220,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Half of the movie is amazingly slow and dramatic. In my opinion it is really predictable after the first ten minutes. It is not a bad movie but It is also not one of my ""master-piece"" movies list.</div>",Negative
221,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I mean, why bother with a bad copy? Just watch Taxi Driver and The king of comedy. Or better yet, take the DVD's, put them in an video editor, make random cuts of each and export a 2 hour movie with scenes of both. Watch it in bed when you are feeling sleepy so you get a little confused and I GUARANTEE you that you gonna get something pretty similar to the joker. Really.. not worth it.If you wanna watch an Scorsese type movie... just watch an Scorsese's movie.</div>",Negative
222,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I get the madness, the depression, the knocks, the highs and the tragedy. Every part of these traits is covered extremely well by the very impressive Joaquin's ""Joker"".<br/><br/>But the film itself is just so boring. I was just wishing it would get out of second gear. Pleading that it might pull out into the fast lane to overtake the heavy juggernaut of another mundane movie. For this baby was the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa of comic book movies. Surely it should leave all before it for dust.<br/><br/>Sadly it never did.<br/><br/>If you want to see a man's desperate fall into madness, sadness and then ultimately loosing it. Go see Falling Down. It's a damn sight better than this.</div>",Negative
223,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie drags and takes to long to make a point. I was waiting for the point for him to start his descent into madness which didn't occur till around the 30 min mark. This movie is way too long.</div>",Negative
224,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't get it. What's all the hype about?
I watched it last night and to me it was just another average movie, nothing more. I even felt like at times it was too slow and it was getting kind of boring.</div>",Negative
225,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I knew going into the movie that it wasn't a superhero movie and I was fine with that. I wasn't expecting explosions or action. But I was expecting something more than just watching Phoenix laugh and dance for an hour. I could simply say it was slow, but that doesn't say enough. It was boring! I admit, Drama isn't my favorite genre, but I still expect more than just staring at people with no dialog. The ""twists"" were not anything big or anything a normal person couldn't see coming. Really I don't think the story fits with my imagination of who the Joker is, but that's fine. Phoenix did a great job! But this could have easily been just a movie where Phoenix showcases his talent without him becoming the Joker. I wonder if the reviews would be the same if it was just titled ""Laughing Man""...</div>",Negative
226,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Sorry, I watched this movie and it was very dark and so slow. It was more about how someone mistreated can become a psychopath than it was about the Joker. Not at all like Gotham or even earlier Batman movies. Sure, Joaquin did a good job of acting, but the movie was a drag and unless you really get off on watching nut jobs it was certainly not entertaining. Hollywood loved it because they like blood, guts, and sick people. Besides, there are so many terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, even a mediocre movie gets a 4-star rating because the others are just so bad. In this movie, there were some parts that were soooo slow I used 2x just to move things along. It helped. Could not wait for it to end. This is a dreary movie and not entertainment. Hollywood movies just get sicker and they like it.</div>",Negative
227,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's pretty clear this film makes a lot of people believe they understand mental health more than they did before watching it. If they DO understand it better, hooray, but I suspect that for many it enhances real understanding little more than Rain Man did for Autism. Rather anecdotally and surface.
So, in my view, another opportunity missed.
But what really disappointed me was Phoenix. He was amazing in Gladiator, and probably did a better illumination of mental health in that.
I was looking at my watch from 40' into Joker, and pretty much every 20' from there. Just didn't do it for me, sorry.</div>",Negative
228,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The trailer of the movie was really very good and attractive! The people's reviews also made me madly curious about the movie
When I watched the movie i found good things but these don't include the story
The movie is boring in general, I just can't find why people got crazy about it</div>",Negative
229,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boring movie rather watched something else and saved myself a cheeky tenner 👍</div>",Negative
230,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Sure Phoenix's acting is good, but I found the movie boring and depressing. His character is just sad, empty and pathetic and this is what gives the tone to the whole movie. At the end we're not sure what's real and what's not, but it doesn't matter to me because there's no payoff.</div>",Negative
231,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know everyone wants to give a good actor kudos. I get that. The movie was drab. I got sick of watching it. Yes, it shows how a disturbed person can regress, but it moves slowly and loses its grip. For those in the psychological thriller genre it may have value.</div>",Negative
232,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know how people get mad at disney films for taking classic beloved films and selling them as new movies? Well I'd argue that that's exactly what Joker is doing. The film is basically a remake of ""The King of Comedy"" that brings nothing new to the table. I'd actually that Joker is almost worse than these Disney remakes because at least people Disney remakes don't try to trick their audiences into believing they're doing anything new. This film, on the other hand, does nothing new but still tries to dupe its audience into thinking its a groundbreaking work of art. Sure, this style of filmmaking is new for the genre, but this doesn't mean it's not a completely unoriginal film with nothing to say. It's the plot of King of Comedy and the themes of Taxi Driver. That's it. It thinks it's a lot smarter than it is. It takes so much from other films without recognizing what made these films great.<br/><br/>Phoenix gives a great performance though</div>",Negative
233,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There appears to be sharply divided reactions to this film. Reading some of the other reviews, people thought it was brilliant, or a piece of garbage.
My own opinion - I hated it. The best aspect of Joker is Joaquin Phoenixs' acting. He did a great job with a crappy script and a mostly incoherent story. Forget any relation to the Heath Ledger portrayal of Joker, which was smart and perfectly played. This version of Joker has little to do with Batman, although there are scattered connections in the film.
I'm sorry I watched this. Guess I hoped it would get better, but for me, it just stayed at awful throughout.</div>",Negative

235,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like watching 2 hours of dark depressing material with little or no plot or memorable scenes then this is for you.

237,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I walked out. This should have been aired on Netflix. It is terrible.infused superhero make-up yarn about something else indy. What am I watching? Norm Bates. Never the Joker. Insert fake medical condition. People laugh when they're nervous, is there a diganosis like Parkenson where they don't stop laughing? No. Although after this film who knows?<br/><br/>He was a megalomaniac, pure killer, schizo. It developed from trauma. Youth. The Joker wasn't this. A black comedy.<br/><br/>When does he become the Joker? I wasn't gonna stick around. Faceplam<br/><br/>All this film is was another attempt at normalizing a fantasy universe into real people and real politics, today. They've the got mental health, but we better just pretend why they're paid. What? So it stole the fantasy. And it offered us psychology. Who would have watched it if they knew it was this? Would it be breaking its box office? No. So they inserted this. Disappointed. Get your own psychodrama. Give us back the comics. Come on.<br/><br/>Only rating it 4 for the Joker, Heath Ledger. What a shame.</div>",Negative

Sure, this style of filmmaking is new for the genre, but this doesn't mean it's not a completely unoriginal film with nothing to say. It's the plot of King of Comedy and the themes of Taxi Driver. That's it. It thinks it's a lot smarter than it is. It takes so much from other films without recognizing what made these films great.<br/><br/>Phoenix gives a great performance though</div>",Negative
247,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The trailer of the movie was really very good and attractive! The people's reviews also made me madly curious about the movie
When I watched the movie i found good things but these don't include the story

248,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's pretty clear this film makes a lot of people believe they understand mental health more than they did before watching it. If they DO understand it better, hooray, but I suspect that for many it enhances real understanding little more than Rain Man did for Autism. Rather anecdotally and surface.
So, in my view, another opportunity missed.
But what really disappointed me was Phoenix. He was amazing in Gladiator, and probably did a better illumination of mental health in that.
I was looking at my watch from 40' into Joker, and pretty much every 20' from there. Just didn't do it for me, sorry.</div>",Negative
249,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I knew going into the movie that it wasn't a superhero movie and I was fine with that. I wasn't expecting explosions or action. But I was expecting something more than just watching Phoenix laugh and dance for an hour. I could simply say it was slow, but that doesn't say enough. It was boring! I admit, Drama isn't my favorite genre, but I still expect more than just staring at people with no dialog. The ""twists"" were not anything big or anything a normal person couldn't see coming. Really I don't think the story fits with my imagination of who the Joker is, but that's fine. Phoenix did a great job! But this could have easily been just a movie where Phoenix showcases his talent without him becoming the Joker. I wonder if the reviews would be the same if it was just titled ""Laughing Man""...</div>",Negative
250,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Sorry, I watched this movie and it was very dark and so slow. It was more about how someone mistreated can become a psychopath than it was about the Joker. Not at all like Gotham or even earlier Batman movies. Sure, Joaquin did a good job of acting, but the movie was a drag and unless you really get off on watching nut jobs it was certainly not entertaining. Hollywood loved it because they like blood, guts, and sick people. Besides, there are so many terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, even a mediocre movie gets a 4-star rating because the others are just so bad. In this movie, there were some parts that were soooo slow I used 2x just to move things along. It helped. Could not wait for it to end. This is a dreary movie and not entertainment. Hollywood movies just get sicker and they like it.</div>",Negative
251,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't get it. What's all the hype about?
I watched it last night and to me it was just another average movie, nothing more. I even felt like at times it was too slow and it was getting kind of boring.</div>",Negative
252,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie drags and takes to long to make a point. I was waiting for the point for him to start his descent into madness which didn't occur till around the 30 min mark. This movie is way too long.</div>",Negative
253,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I get the madness, the depression, the knocks, the highs and the tragedy. Every part of these traits is covered extremely well by the very impressive Joaquin's ""Joker"".<br/><br/>But the film itself is just so boring. I was just wishing it would get out of second gear. Pleading that it might pull out into the fast lane to overtake the heavy juggernaut of another mundane movie. For this baby was the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa of comic book movies. Surely it should leave all before it for dust.<br/><br/>Sadly it never did.<br/><br/>If you want to see a man's desperate fall into madness, sadness and then ultimately loosing it. Go see Falling Down. It's a damn sight better than this.</div>",Negative

260,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boring movie rather watched something else and saved myself a cheeky tenner 👍</div>",Negative
261,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Sure Phoenix's acting is good, but I found the movie boring and depressing. His character is just sad, empty and pathetic and this is what gives the tone to the whole movie. At the end we're not sure what's real and what's not, but it doesn't matter to me because there's no payoff.</div>",Negative
262,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know everyone wants to give a good actor kudos. I get that. The movie was drab. I got sick of watching it. Yes, it shows how a disturbed person can regress, but it moves slowly and loses its grip. For those in the psychological thriller genre it may have value.</div>",Negative
263,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know how people get mad at disney films for taking classic beloved films and selling them as new movies? Well I'd argue that that's exactly what Joker is doing. The film is basically a remake of ""The King of Comedy"" that brings nothing new to the table. I'd actually that Joker is almost worse than these Disney remakes because at least people Disney remakes don't try to trick their audiences into believing they're doing anything new.

264,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There appears to be sharply divided reactions to this film. Reading some of the other reviews, people thought it was brilliant, or a piece of garbage.
My own opinion - I hated it. The best aspect of Joker is Joaquin Phoenixs' acting. He did a great job with a crappy script and a mostly incoherent story. Forget any relation to the Heath Ledger portrayal of Joker, which was smart and perfectly played. This version of Joker has little to do with Batman, although there are scattered connections in the film.
I'm sorry I watched this. Guess I hoped it would get better, but for me, it just stayed at awful throughout.</div>",Negative
265,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is a note for note rip off of Taxi Dirver and King of Comedy, only it is utterly lacking in substance.</div>",Negative
266,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like watching 2 hours of dark depressing material with little or no plot or memorable scenes then this is for you. Yes I know it's a character study but I think a film should be entertaining in some way or other, there's even no light relief from the gloom. One boring scene to the next. I'd say avoid. How it's running at 9 on IMDb I'm not sure</div>",Negative
267,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">But tollywood movie kalki was realy good thrilling and last end was suprising its wonderfully directed.</div>",Negative
268,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I walked out. This should have been aired on Netflix. It is terrible.infused superhero make-up yarn about something else indy. What am I watching? Norm Bates. Never the Joker. Insert fake medical condition. People laugh when they're nervous, is there a diganosis like Parkenson where they don't stop laughing? No. Although after this film who knows?<br/><br/>He was a megalomaniac, pure killer, schizo. It developed from trauma. Youth. The Joker wasn't this. A black comedy.<br/><br/>When does he become the Joker? I wasn't gonna stick around. Faceplam<br/><br/>All this film is was another attempt at normalizing a fantasy universe into real people and real politics, today. They've the got mental health, but we better just pretend why they're paid. What? So it stole the fantasy. And it offered us psychology. Who would have watched it if they knew it was this? Would it be breaking its box office? No. So they inserted this. Disappointed. Get your own psychodrama. Give us back the comics. Come on.<br/><br/>Only rating it 4 for the Joker, Heath Ledger. What a shame.</div>",Negative
269,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After a certain point it becomes callous. On the same reflexion but reality based Cuck does a better job. Because for all the hype, don't forget Joker is just DC comics character.</div>",Negative
270,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">... Chapter Two, the OTHER killer clown in theaters.<br/><br/>This Joker movie is ripe with cynicism, it probably is the only way to get the audience to sympathize with a sociopathic killer. Yuck</div>",Negative
271,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Hi, first of all I tried not to compare this to Heath's performance, but after half the film passed by the grip of what could have and replaced by oh no, I must say Joker's display was one of feeble stance. Sure life knocks you in the face with iron knuckles, yet Heath showed it could be appreciated with a smirk. Phoenix buckles inward because he just can't help it and doesn't like it.
This might have been set up as a possible gate way to how and when he started to be Joker as we all hoped to see, but it sure as beep left me seeing a sorry of an excuse to turn so dark for some everyday struggle gone bad and turn left at revenge intersection.
Never was, in my recollection, Joker set out best as the dog who didn't know what he'd do once he got hold of the bumper of a car going by. Now they showed a possible reason why, and deep down they shouldn't have showed this. It's too beep easy passing the start frame and collect your 2000. Joker is matured insanity, should they have put some in the movie all could have been overlooked.</div>",Negative
272,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie seems to drag on towards the end. And when they do end the movie it was very unsatisfying. I felt like there were multiple times to end the movie before they did that were much better. The acting was good overall.</div>",Negative

275,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">FILME ENROLADO, FRACO. FINAL ATÉ FICA UNS 10 MINUTOS INTERESSANTE. MAS NA BOA.. CAGARAM COM A FIGURA DO VILÃO CORINGA. PODRE. VAI ASSISTIR BATMAN, CAVALEIRO DAS TREVAS, QUE É MELHOR.</div>",Negative
276,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My friends looked at me as if I was a crazy person when I told them I didn't like this movie as much a they did. I'm still baffled by the amount of 10s this movie has on this site, am I missing something? This movie follows a lot of the beats from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, to the point where it becomes distracting. De Niro is even cast as a Rupert Pupkin kind of character, its so obvious. The film tries to be a solemn and in-depth look at mental illness, when in fact its just shallow origin story that takes itself so seriously, it borders on parody. The movie looks good and Joaquin Phoenix gives a very committed performance. The craft on display, the cinematography, and Joaquin's performance are highlights, but none of that is able to elevate the fact that this film has the emotional depth of an angsty teenager. 2017's You Were Never Really Here is a better Joker, which is also about a damaged protagonist living with his sick mother.</div>",Negative
277,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix carries this movie 100%. The script is a bit heavy-handed to say the least. It is an entertaining movie however, great for watching with friends or family. It is pretty edgy with the story and the whole world is just made to give Phoenix the middle finger.</div>",Negative
278,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Good movie that is too overrated<br/><br/>Great acting but slow and what people and reviews mention set your expectations way up to its actual value</div>",Negative
279,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Music: great.
His performance: more than great.
Script: meh.</div>",Negative
280,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I found the movie quite boring. It did drag on for a long time without a lot happening.</div>",Negative
281,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story is kind of attractive and ever joker fan have these questions in his mind that movie will answer these questions.
Also a valuable message from this message should be delivered and understandable for the community.
The thing is the movie in many time are very boring. No sense of attractive. No action points that you always try to follow. Joker actor from my point of view is less than expected comparing with Jared Leto or Heath Ledger.</div>",Negative
282,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mentally ill clown breaks down and sparks a revolution? And all this in two weeks? And to top it off an epilogue which made no sense.
JP is a great actor, but that's all that is good about this pretentious film.</div>",Negative
283,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Irresponsible to artistically exploit gun violence causing cops to clock in constantly, and irresponsible to totally take this character out of context for a vanity art project. Who the hell is Arthur Fleck in the DC universe?? Sigh. Disloyalty.</div>",Negative
284,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a different kind of ""superhero"" movie that has more in common with Scorcese drama and less with the faeces films of the MCU, but that doesn't mean it is actually that good.<br/><br/>It takes itself way too seriously in a way that doesn't add any depth. The tempo is unbalanced. Phoenix does a good job, but the character is simply an impression of a violently psychotic individual, rather than an accurate portrayal. Camera, lighting and music are alright, but tedious. All in all this is a decently made, rather boring film that will mostly appeal to people with little sense of relativity and it would have been better without the comic book element.<br/><br/>And by the way, when it comes to that comic book aspect, they completely missed the point of the character.</div>",Negative
285,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't really see why this is getting rave reviews from everyone. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either in my opinion. Just Meh. Decent acting but that's about where it ends... probably wouldn't watch again. A bit of a snooze fest.</div>",Negative
286,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I feel like I've seen a different movie to everyone else because the Joker I seen was not a hauntingly dark masterpiece with excellent character development that breaks the mould of the genre. The Joker I seen was one which is so pretentious and pleased with itself that it has made a ""deep"" movie about how society is filled with empty promises that it doesn't seem to realise it has artificially made itself ""deep"" as it doesn't really have anything new or interested to say. its an unoriginal overrated wannabe artsy film that borrows so heavily from superior films (Fight Club, Taxi Driver) that it gives the illusion of a great film. This artificial idea that this is more than a movie and the try hard artsy elements will be enough to impress some but those who scratch just beneath the surface will release this movie is filled with nothing but old copies of Taxi Driver, Fight Club and dead wasps.</div>",Negative
287,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Doesn't do the character of the Joker justice. The joker I know is smart and brutal. This joker is a crybaby and all feats are accomplished through sheer luck.</div>",Negative
288,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the most pretentious films I've watched in the recent past. Average movie goers have referred to this film as masterpiece. Unfortunately, this movie was outright terrible. All it did was copy (""Inspiration"") Scorsese's taxi driver and put a joker character in.<br/><br/>Apart from the great acting, everything about this film was below average. Don't let the high ratings fool you. The legacy of joker from The dark knight has played an important role in overhyping this film by the joker fan base.</div>",Negative
289,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So high expectations of this movie but it was a great dissapointment
Boring just boring
Compared to the dark night( with a class performance of heath ledger) this is rubbish
The critics love it strangely because its cultural and great acting by phoenix and that maybe so but i want to see an entertaining movie....major dissapointment....the 3,5 houre movie the irishman from scorcese was much better!</div>",Negative
290,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Anorexic version of the Joker. A main stream film character was turned into an art film character. Joaqim Phoenix couldn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's Joker, plus the constant laughter just got more irritating as the film progressed.</div>",Negative
291,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first hour and a half of this movie drags.The last half hour gets more interesting.This wasnt the joker we know from the comics.I dont know what it was.He lacked maniacal energy.Ugh.Blaah! I gave it four stars for his performance ...but zero for verything else</div>",Negative
292,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well... Pheonix is a good actor and done a great job i really liked his role in Gladiator back in 2000 but as you wait for something to happen in this movie you get only his weird laughter.
I wouldnt call it an action movie , some of it felt like low budget movie</div>",Negative
293,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The rating of this movie here at IMDB made me really look forward to watching this. The acting was really good and the story tragic but watching a depressed schizophrenic that is out of his mind is not very interesting and gets old and boring very quickly. Perhaps this movie would give you the same experience as visiting the looney bin and getting to know some of the characters there? It's not really my idea of entertainment.</div>",Negative
294,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not sure how this movie got such a high rating, Acting was good but the actual movie and storyline was a snoozer... found myself checking email vs watching this movie.</div>",Negative
295,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Any movie or TV show depicting tobacco use in such quantity should never get more than a five.
Oh, cut out all nudity, but show someone smoking as much as possible, that will bring in some extra cash from the young ones.</div>",Negative
296,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant acting by Phoenix, but the movie is long and boring.</div>",Negative
297,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's about 12 seconds of action in this entire slogfest of a film, but I guess congrats to Joaquin for getting rail skinny.</div>",Negative
298,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Maybe it because I´m not a Joker fan, but the melancholy and depression in this movie is just to much. I feel like the movie has one message, feel bad. And Jerad Leto´s Joker was a bit more fun, in a non fun kind of way.<br/><br/>I just don´t like when movies try to hard to be ""artsy"" and deep, especially when it´s a Batman villain.<br/><br/>And also the hole ""feel bad for the bad guy"" thing might have worked for Thanos, but not for the Joker.<br/><br/>I was so bored that I almost left the theater. But that is just me, obviously a lot of people like it so good for them :). I am truly glad for there sake. :)</div>",Negative
299,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Maybe it was what the director was trying for. The plot developed slowly, and never really took off. Not a movie that I'd want to watch again.
Just my personal opinion, others liked it more.</div>",Negative
300,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Probably this is the second bad joker after Heath Ledger's death. Film acts like we are kid or something. Why shows us all things that why joker gone mad? Who need this also? Even J. Phoenix, himself, did not save the film. This lore could be better than this.</div>",Negative
301,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie didn't feel like 1981. The first half is dragging a lot and is quite predictable. Only when Arthur meets Bruce the movie builds up a bit of momentum. The depiction of Arthurs mental state didn't convince me at all. Overly long scenes of annoying laughter and strange dancing. Ok, Arthurs strategy to flee from his frustrating existence. Still, not gripping, not disturbing, not convincing, just annoying!<br/><br/>And then, ""look how much weight I lost for this movie, look how thin I am! Oscar-worthy, isn't it?""<br/><br/>The movie borrows heavily from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, but lacks in depth, tension and substance.<br/><br/>Shallow entertainment with a slightly better second half, but overall disappointing!</div>",Negative
302,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm afraid the film is as a disaster as J. Phoenix is an extraordinary actor. The intensity of his acting fades out as the film develops through a meaningless scenario. Joker is unfortunately a false antisystemic film with countless deficiencies. It really manages to pass a great psychological picture of an emblematic figure, a comic superhero, but fails in recreating the real world of Joker. J. Phoenix has a great role, but the audience is not there to be his therapist. Evenmore to my surprise, I realized that even Robert De Niro seems too small in front of J. Phoenix. So I will give an applause to J. Phoenix and 0 stars to the film.</div>",Negative
303,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really expected much more. Nothing entertaining, disruptive or breathtaking. Somewhat predictable (the relationship with the neighbour) and left me wanting at the end.</div>",Negative
304,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The character was played flawlessly, no words to describe it, it felt like Joaquin Phoenix is the new machinist Christian bale, just by looking at the kinda body he has made for this movie. Being the backstory of the supervillain, I expected some personal attack but this was merely based upon the jobless scenario that happened over the country a few decades back, which means there should be several other super villains as well.
About Acting: Sometimes while watching the movie, it felt that Kamal Hassan from Tamil cinema has done so much variety of actings that cannot even be recreated by these Hollywood folks. Hmmm.</div>",Negative
305,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A good back story but nothing to get excited about. If I was at home watching it instead of the cinema I might have fallen asleep.</div>",Negative
306,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first half is quite good. After that it seems like someone tried to mix ""a"" Batman story with a bunch of social/life themes. Caca.
I really hated the use of the Frank Sinatra song. Please do not make a sequel. I'm forever haunted.
P.S. Joaquin is good. That's all I got.</div>",Negative
307,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I honestly think that if it was just a regular movie itd be ok but to tie it to batman and say that this is the joker is crap. My bf said ""it was a great origin story"" bs the joker already has an origin and this was not it. If they gave it different name and said he was a rando psycho from gotham maybe but this is just bs</div>",Negative
308,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is great, (i still like Heath Ledgers joker more) but i personally just couldn't get into the movie at all, because it is the story of a man with deep mental problems, and for me to like a movie i have to be able to relate to the main character at some level, how little it sometimes is and in this one i am totally missing that</div>",Negative
309,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie show how ill is today's society. Yes, Phoenix played awesome his role. But the whole movie was terrible and hard to watch. Sorry for lost 2 hours in my life to watch it. I expected from this to be action movie like batman series not a movie for mental ill person and tragically story</div>",Negative
310,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well don't see what the big fuss is about the actor was great but there are a lot of better DC and Marvel movies they dragged out him before he became the Joker to long while I stayed and watched it all a lot of people left before it was over the only exciting part of the movie was the last 15 -20 minutes of it Wonder Woman and Aquaman was leaps and bounds over this film almost not worth my money to see it in theater.</div>",Negative
311,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not all what I expected, took way to long to move the plot forward, last half hour not bad. Joacim gave a good performance but I must have missed something, I thought it was boring. Still just my opinion but no idea why it has 8.8 rating</div>",Negative
312,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As unrest unravels across the world, Joker shines. This is the best origin story for which I could have asked. What's there to say that hasn't been said?<br/><br/><ul><li>Phoenix has peaked here.</li><li>Great soundtrack (though I dislike the emotional cuing in some of the score)</li><li>Masterful plot with greater themes</li></ul><br/><br/>Mental health is an ongoing crisis in the United States and it needs to be addressed properly as well as mass shootings. I do not believe this film incites violence, but merely shows the dire consequences when people who are deemed crazy are marginalized, dehumanized, and treated like mere clowns.</div>",Positive
313,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Strip away everything people are criticizing this movie about. I saw it tonight and it is a good movie. People and half baked critics are reading their own political narratives into this movie. In fact, the movie practically jokes within itself that it's not meant to be political. It's a good movie with twists and is a very believable origin story. Its realistic in its story and doesn't pretend otherwise.</div>",Positive
314,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix nails this role as joker and he is one of the best joker versions in history he stole every scene he was in but that stole some spotlight for some other charcters</div>",Positive
315,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's thought provoking I have so many theories and it really made me fell for him to the point where when he put on the make up I didn't want him to become the Joker</div>",Positive
316,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As someone who was abused for years as a child, and felt like an outcast from society throughout my youth, I can relate to the torment Arthur feels surrounding his existence here on earth. Thankfully for me I did not seek violence as retribution, although I certainly thought about it. A dark film, a meaty film, and one that makes us all think, ""We must account for our actions as individuals, no matter who we are.""</div>",Positive
317,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The most controversial film of the year is also one of the best. This may have not been the best time to release this type of film, but from a pure technical standpoint; it's damn good. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal and should nab him the Oscar. The direction by Phillips is also some of the best this year as he really captures the environment by providing us with great cinematography and storytelling. The score is also an amazing addition to the film as it captures the overall mood of the film. Did this film stretch a little too long and is it disturbing? Absolutely. Do I really want to watch this again? No. It's filmmaking at its finest though.</div>",Positive
318,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've just finished watching this movie, what i can say that, When all ways to be good are blocked, when society Prisons someone in cell of fears, anxiety, judgement, poverty and lies, Jokers inside them will be unleashed with no single regret for doing evil. Mr.Joaquin with an exceptional performance and great character shifting from an innocent kid inside him to a monster punishes society for neglecting him. I see that The machinist movie affected this character also taxi driver. Thank you Mr. De Niro for your appearance that always makes the difference. Academy, please give This Joker an Oscar or don't.. it doesn't matter. We loved it</div>",Positive
319,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will keep it short and sweet-<br/><br/>Fantastic acting, music, and technical parts. This movie is slow but works to create a mesmerizing story. I can't wait for the discussions to begin and deepen.<br/><br/>Watch this film and be the judge of it for yourself.</div>",Positive
320,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Pure classic,masterpiece,deep dark,utterly beautiful cinematic movie of this year!
Joaquin phoenix showed the oscarworthy and devastating performance!And the last scene was extremely unacceptable,questionable and unbelievable!
Thanks to todd philips for reimaginated one of the most iconic villain in cinema history!</div>",Positive
321,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A great, dark film with the best acting coming from Phoenix. Totally believable crazy character. He's just a genius. The only reason I didn't rate it 10 is because they wrongly used a peadaphiles music in an amazing scene with the Joker dancing down the steps after brutally murdering his ex colleague.</div>",Positive
322,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I haven't seen any reviews of Joker, but I can there is sure to be a lot of comparisons between this and the dark knight. It is probably the biggest compliment to Joaquin Phoenix to say that his performance is certainly comparable to Heath Ledger in the dark knight.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly dark in mood and there are many things relevant to real life in the 21st century. The movie tells the story of how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker. It is a tough watch, but brilliantly shot and acted. The only thing I would question is the playing of a Gary Glitter song.<br/><br/>If you are into feel good movies then the Joker will not be for you. If you want to see a great acting performance then you'll be hard pushed to beat Joaquin Phoenix in 2019.</div>",Positive
323,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If anything, see this movie for Joaquin Phoenixs ghastly transformation and overall delivery - Oscar worthy for sure. The theme of ""fractured identity"" was well explored in the film, a plus. The ""rich vs poor"" theme also permeates the movie - but, conversely, I felt that could have been much more originally explored than it was. The cinematography is one of the film's strongest offerings. Easy contender for one of the year's most original films.</div>",Positive
324,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is very nice film but the world is not that bad</div>",Positive
325,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It won't be like the joker in the dark night ,but it's good you can say this movie is the best movie in 2019</div>",Positive
326,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a drama movie presenting philosophic questioning on eartling and criticism against system. It tells the story of well-known character of DC, Joker, and how he evolved from a mentally ill person to killing machine &amp; insane person.<br/><br/>I didn't like the cigarette product placement and its slow going plot. I wish there had been more drama and action scene in it.<br/><br/>It is worth to watch if you know enough about previous DC movies. Otherwise, it might seems to be bad movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.</div>",Positive
327,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not the best of movies..but a good watch overall..</div>",Positive
328,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I sleep it's boring more then "" ad astra "" i like the actor he's good</div>",Positive
329,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best associated with anarchy and uncontrollable chaos, the film takes you through a twisted series of events that propel a man on the verge of insanity, to jump off this steep pinnacle with glee.<br/><br/>Here, the titular protagonist isn't heralded or framed as a solution, but rather as a deadly consequence of an ignorant society, that nearly drove itself insane in the process.<br/><br/>Diagnosed as heavily demented and severely mentally disordered, Joker is a film that'll have you laughing at the wrong moments, where comedy is used as a means of destruction, promoting stress rather than relieving it.<br/><br/>Blurring the canonical line between fantasy and reality, it is a careless and mesmerizing descent into madness.</div>",Positive
330,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It can be better. Always we are ledger :) but this mean is not phoneix is bad.</div>",Positive
331,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched joker i enjoyed the acting of joaquin Phoenix..Direction is very good but lackes of twists. First half is good and second half is terrorize you.. don't compare with The Legend Heath Ledger ..and Christopher nolan ..i gave 8 star only for Joaquin Phoenix</div>",Positive
332,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really the acting of Joachim Phoenix deserves all the greetings for this movie that are heard thought these days. But we have to consider some facts. First of all the story of Batman from another point of view is really smart, it deserves your attention. the main concept of the movie is that the results of continuous bulling to a person can lead to great outbursts of anger and violence that is the fact, so imagine now that person to be emotionally unstable like Joker(that is the moment that joker is born). Also I want to mention that the smoking propaganda through the whole movie is really outrageous.</div>",Positive
333,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The performance of Joaquin Phoenix was iconic but the story was disturbing the violance was high during the movie and psychological games was annoying its seems that the director and the author was intentionally make the audience feel disturbed really big shout for them because they success with me</div>",Positive
334,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you ignore the ""greatest film ever"" shouts from people who have probably never watched a non comic book movie this a surprisingly strong effort. It goes all out in its attempts to re-imagine a fairly one note villain as the subject of a Scorsese outsider character study and actually manages to escape from under the weight of its much referenced influences to stand as its own take on the subject. It might not have much new to say but the outstanding cinematography and a top form Joachim Phoenix lift the film above the usual genre fair and only occasionally overblown direction and a clunky, completely unnecessary ""evil society"" monologue hold it back.</div>",Positive
335,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie certainly deserves 8 points.
-1
I'm going to a point I don't like. I wish the conversion to the Joker was a little faster.
-2
The things I like: the music was very impressive, the appearance was very good, Joaquin Phoenix made a very nice acting. I was impressed every time the Joker danced.
-3
It is normal for the film to be +18 because the film has a heavy psychological pressure and the film deals with a somewhat dangerous subject, ""Anarchism.. There are 2-3 bloody scenes, because of psychological pressure, these bloody scenes can evoke a sense of violence.
-4
I want to take this film as a classic and I suggest you watch it in no time.</div>",Positive
336,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Made me see it twice in the cinema.
Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation is incredible.</div>",Positive
337,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a perception of a character in the batman universe that is much more clever than you initially think.
Firstly it's in my opinion that a Joker franchise is needed this movie left me wanting to watch a continued journey of the characters development and wanted to see it dig deeper, get darker, and make me feel even more discomfort. I love the R rated hero movies much more than the marvel movies but that may just be preference. I love gritty realities that push the boundaries.
And i see a dark but beautiful future for joker movies that contain no limits, no restrictions.
This movie depicts a series of events that no one really knows whether happened or did not. Except from the killing of Bruce Waynes parents.
Its a slow and well told tale and anyone who attempts to present a performance of an insane protagonist will prevail because there are no restrictions and it opens up a side to story telling and performance that really can go in any direction.
And i think both the actor and director produced a compelling piece of cinematography, that will be remembered by many</div>",Positive
338,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Going into this movie I expected an insane Joker movie that tied into the Batman universe with an old storyline from the comics but I have never been so glad to have been wrong about a movie Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker in such a unique and terrifyingly insane way that weirdly makes a more realistic Joker even more twisted and crazy when his actions are a result of a tragic life and insane world that beats him down again and again till only the clown remains.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job at misdirecting the audience making you think you know how its gunna go then switches it on you and leaves you looking the clown.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet go see it you will not be disappointed it's insanity is on another level.</div>",Positive
339,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My first review. Not only is Todd Phillip's 'Joker' an incredible character study with Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck, but there are so many filmmaking techniques involved to make this film special. The use of certain colors to portray a dark Gotham City (which is really NYC), brilliant cinematography, clever shot structure and great direction. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win his first Oscar for this performance, then nobody should. This is coming from someone who is not at all a fan of DC or Marvel, which should show you how very special this film really is. Nothing, in my opinion, will ever top Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, but Joaquin Phoenix is just as great here, as he really allows the audience to witness Arthur Fleck's descent into becoming the Joker. Go watch this film and enjoy Phoenix's remarkable portrayal of one of cinema's most villainous characters.</div>",Positive
340,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After years of superhero films with massive budgets and incredible CGI, of which there is nothing wrong, it was great to see a film that was just that, a great film with a great story that was brilliantly acted, without the need for massive special effects.<br/><br/>I really can see this being the film that launches 1000 copy cats and creates is own genre, blurring the line of good and evil.<br/><br/>I was slightly concerned that now the moral overtone could become that the bad are bad because the rich made them that way and so become the victims but maybe that's just another new perspective.<br/><br/>Whatever is a brilliant film and phoenix deserves an Oscar for it. The best lead I have seen this year without doubt.</div>",Positive
341,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know this is ranked as a Drama movie, but knowing the protagonist, I expected more action.</div>",Positive
342,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Review (1~5)<br/><br/>#Content: Script 4 / Acting 5 / Cinematography 5 / Film Editing 5<br/><br/>#Visual: Costume Design 5 / Makeup &amp; Hairstyling 5 / Scenic Design 5 / Lighting 5 / Visual Effects 5<br/><br/>#Sound: Score &amp; Soundtracks 5 / Sound Editing &amp; Mixing 5<br/><br/>#Overall (1~10): 8</div>",Positive
343,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The director did the right thing naming the movie ""Joker"" and not ""The Joker"". This is not a movie about the super villain of Gotham but how he became that.
Joaquin Phoenix? THE GREATEST. I won't compare HIM with Heath Ledger because it's impossible. They incarnated two different faces of the character and there is no comparison.
Undoubtedly you are not going to watch the most popular and loved badass but Joaquin Phoenix making HISTORY.</div>",Positive
344,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was really hyped when about to go see this movie. I'm afraid that it might just have been that... hype. The movie was slow in the beginning but took up speed in the last act.
It was good but not as good as people said</div>",Positive
345,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It worth all the waiting, can't say anything just a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
346,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A bold and lively film, with a bouncy rhythm that makes it appealing. It has, of course, depicted a lot of violence.</div>",Positive
347,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant narration around a superb oscar-nom worthy performance from the everembrassing Joaquin Phoenix.
Only real issue I have is when a major origin story of a beloved(?) character only takes around 10 days to complet; leaves me lacking more background.
Other than that, an utter disturbingly excellent and buzzkiller piece of American cinema.</div>",Positive
348,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No, this isn't going to be a testimony as to why this film is so socially important. Is it, though? Maybe. Probably not. In the end it tells the story of a severely mentally ill man. That premise stays the same throughout the whole film. The message is obvious, but if you try not to take it too seriously, Joker is quite capable of getting under your skin. Just how he would have liked it.</div>",Positive
349,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film is unique and interesting in so many different ways, It tells the story of a man who hasn't achieved anything in his life and is dealing with some incredibly horrible mental health and emotional issues, trying to escape his sorrow and achieve true happiness by making a statement about his life and showing the world his sense of humor and trying to make comedy about his life. It's an incredible performance from Jaoquin Pheonix portraying a man trying to find the comedy in the circumstances he lives in. Incredible acting, worldbuilding, cinematography and directing. Must see movie</div>",Positive
350,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The storyline is very nice! The beginning of the movie was kinda long, and the sad cello after every moment was kinda dramatic. But the storyline was good</div>",Positive
351,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a very captivating movie with a nice performance by Phoenix but the music was overdramatic and went on and on for more than necessary. The soundtrack was kind of a big thing for a movie like this so I feel like it wasn't as good as I would have expected.</div>",Positive
352,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First 90 minutes were a waste of time, last 30 minutes were incredible</div>",Positive
353,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It felt more like a movie about mental illness than something connected to a superhero universe. This doesn't make it bad, just unexpected.
The main thing that bothered me was his age. The Joker will be retired before Bruce become Batman. Also felt like he was a little too stuiped to be able to do the stuff the Joker does.
But if you take the thought away from anything you knew about the Joker before watching the movie it was perfection. Joaquin really made you feel pity for the Joker and really made you feel the ups and downs of his character. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this I would be suprised.</div>",Positive
354,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Concludely, I award this here motion picture with a lot of dancing Joaquins out of not enough stand-up cameos.</div>",Positive
355,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">2 hours of mainly sitting in the cinema at an angle, that is how awkward and disturbing this superbly acted and directed movie was.
But why was such a potentially manipulative and violent film only awarded a 15 rating when Alien, that whilst terrifying, was not disturbing or liable to influence vulnerable young minds given an 18?</div>",Positive
356,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's no surprise in the plot. What draws audience is the acting and timely theme of social equity and senseless crimes. The film suggested the causes and the ending seemed to portray Joker in a triumphant way - I gave the writers benefit of the doubt; that this ending was meant to show the ironic turn of Arthur from being an unwanted comedian who liked to cheer people young and old, to being accepted and even followed as a villain-vigilante. I would have given it 9~10 if the film ended in the night scene, but it dragged into more scenes inside a hospital which felt redundant to us sympathetic audience.<br/><br/>The film message to me is not about provoking civil unrest and violent rampage. I see the story as a cautionary tale about missed opportunities for society to come together especially during difficult and uncertain times. Give, not take; trust, not judge. Peace.</div>",Positive
357,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story of how Joker is born from Arthur. A man who suffers severe mental conditions developed over the course of a traumatic life in a crime-ridden society ruled by the filthy rich. To say that he ""snapped"" would be a mild understatement.<br/><br/>The development of the ""Joker"" character is really well done by Joaquin Phoenix from the mental and physical attributes he portrays. The special effects are very subtle to say the least in this regard.<br/><br/>Mentally dark and sinister, peppered with dry humour is an apt description. Plus a few good tunes to boot.</div>",Positive
358,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Joker, after so many incarnations, going in I wasn't sure what to expect. For one, I never really saw Phoenix as the joker, but he undeniably gave a masterful performance as the clown Prince of crime (in my opinion this may have been Joaquins best performance to date). The movie itself touches on a lot with regards to the origin of the joker, in particular his state of mind, which many DC fans know is not an easy thing to pin down. Yet the movie did just that, creating a very real scenario with a real issue without it being too definitive. Highlighting the severity of mental illness one can virtually see the character of the joker develop in front of your eyes and that's just part of the brilliance. It seemed that Joaquin managed to take aspects from all the previous Joker versions and fuse them into one, new original Joker. Going in however, one should note this is not your average comic book story line. There is no batman, no Harley Quinn. It's more of a psychological drama, and provides a lot of food for thought long after the end of the movie.</div>",Positive
359,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is mostly fantasy and very predictable, but definitely good movie material, excellent sound, moody moments and manipulative emotional moments, bring a tissue for the issues! You will need it.</div>",Positive
360,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With Marvel steering the superhero genre toward ensembles, JOKER has a refreshingly isolated feel to it that makes the film something special. While I wouldn't go so far as to call the film a diamond in the rough, it is definitely a gem that will still be worth digging up and revisiting twenty or thirty years from now.</div>",Positive
361,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A success for WB in creating a riveting character study. Joker shows DC still has a fighting chance in securing audience's interest at a moment where Marvel seems its weakest.
Is this film an 8/10? No, closer to a 7.4 but that doesn't mean Joker isn't great. I think that the Joker may be DC's greatest asset given the public's unending affection for the character. Whether Joker's impact is due to the quality of the film or the unanimous interest in the character, one thing is for sure. Joker and the impact it has made will be remembered well after it leaves theaters.</div>",Positive
362,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Apart that life is not such as «that», the movie was very well made and acted..
wonder if this becomes a sequel later, since the real act of Joker has not shown yet.
A great reminder to society that it is crucially important to avoid ignorance for your surroundings.</div>",Positive
363,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A brilliant performance by the lead actor.. Specially his laughter..sab but a brilliant story.. Film clearly achieve its motive by telling the audience why Arthur becomes a joker.. and yes this has a clear relationship with the dc background of darknight..though it doesn't clearly gets into the details of DC... Which was not necessary also... Marvelous performance..must win an Oscar..</div>",Positive
364,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the role of a Psycho Comedian, has acted with great conviction! The movie was made with utmost sincerity, without any ""melodramas""!<br/><br/>But this movie has NO ""usual entertainment value""! Therefore, most people will not see it; although, I know there is a audience for such movies too.<br/><br/>It is a ""dark"" film made with the exclusive intention of winning Awards in film festivals!<br/><br/>I was certainly put off my the Gory scenes of Murders in the film! Why do film-makers show such scenes when you can easily show them in a simple way - but with the same impact on our minds?</div>",Positive
365,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin's performace was brilliant! But I think overall the movie was average. Soundtrack was bad and De Niro didn't sit well in his character. I felt the whole movie's quality was not on par with Joaquin's work. I give it an 8 solely because of his skill which was superb!</div>",Positive
366,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a real good story it was long but worth it to see the actual story of joker the one we always wanted to see!</div>",Positive
367,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Difficult? But so is the obstinate denial that so are we. And moments of nuance beyond the dialogue and cinematography? This film plays heavily upon the cruelty of obstinance intertwining with the decision of obsessive complusive violent vengeance toward the intentional unrelenting inequality that such unreason lays claim into maligned madness. Up there with the Criterion of landmark film, perhaps because it is canon of comic book married with the mastery of psychological film, direction, acting, and a the cleverness of a subconscious implicit narration. This is about the mirrors of the great ""we"" that define humanity. Therefore it is also academic. If that justifies merit or not it still signifies quite the accomplishment of a social science elucidation.</div>",Positive
368,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Joker represents everything people feel against the system in real and this movie is a perfect portrait of that feeling.<br/><br/>As usual Joaquim Pheonix performs perfectly and his unique talent brings the Joker to life.<br/><br/>Hope there is a sequel</div>",Positive
369,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wasn't a big fan of an origin story about The Joker &amp; the movie director is going to be Todd Philips. the movie is totally a masterpiece in acting, music, and cinematography. also, Joaquin Phoenix really really really killed it as The Joker &amp; to me he added another flavor to The Joker's character. the movie is a slow burn &amp; some people who's anticipating some actions would probably be disappointed.
the movie is really a character study &amp; how the society can affect the person's life directly/indirectly.
i'm still shocked &amp; amazed. a lot of scenes gave me the chills but the last act of the movie was totally insane, especially when they started cheering for him &amp; he started to dance above the taxi. Also, i loved how the laughing disease started and changes throughout the movie.</div>",Positive
370,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Personally I think there shud have been more violence. Joker is not a sympathetic character. He's a mentally deranged lunatic ffs. This was a bland Joker if you ask me. Although this film took inspiration from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (Two of my favourite movies of all times) it never has the same menace. Maybe for all the fairy kids these day it will seem cruel or gritty but for an adult that's lived and seen the best and worst of society..... Arthur Fleck is another pansy. Phoenix is good tho. Credit where due.</div>",Positive
371,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So I went to this movie expecting a typical DC type flick, so was very surprised.<br/><br/>The character development is amazing and the back story to the Joker is well thought through and totally believable.<br/><br/>Really clever film and I hope they follow it up with an equally believable Batman movie.<br/><br/>Go watch it, certainly makes you think.</div>",Positive
372,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can not think of a better description. Currently the best movie I've seen this year.</div>",Positive
373,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies i have ever seen..
Great acting , directing &amp; the soundtrack is amazing ..
I think its gone to win next Oscar</div>",Positive
374,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just as provocative, sick and disturbing as I'd hoped it to be. What really exceeded my expectations is Pheonix's terrifyingly unhinged performance that's definitely worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>(8.5/10)</div>",Positive
375,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is very good d mainly for the interpretation of Joachin Phoenix. Also the direction and the screenplay are at the same level. It's worthy to be seen.</div>",Positive
376,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That Joaquin Phoenix performance totally deserves an Oscar award for best actor!</div>",Positive
377,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">O FILME É MUITO BEM PRODUZIDO, TEM UMA ATUAÇÃO MARCANTE Joaquin Phoenix, UMA ÓTIMA PARTICIPAÇÃO DE Robert DeNiro E ALÉM DISSO FINALMENTE EXPLICA POR QUÊ RAIOS DO INFERNO OS PAIS DE BRUCE WAYNE FORAM PASSAR POR AQUELE BECO NO MEIO DA NOITE...<br/><br/>FORA ISSO, O FILME É UM FOLHETIM POLÍTICO DA DICOTOMIA MARXISTA DA LUTA DE CLASSES: POBRES CONTRA RICOS. SÓ FALTOU O ""Lula livre"" NO FINAL...<br/><br/>NÃO É O CORINGA DOS QUADRINHOS. A HISTÓRIA É OUTRA. (Y) #RAZOAVEL</div>",Positive
378,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie was really good the story line and emotions and climax was all right. Well thought of movie. The plots and turns was very well directed. Worth seeing for sure.</div>",Positive
379,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Have they pushed the boundaries? Can you joke about everything now? Does humor objective or subjective?</div>",Positive
380,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Superhero (or villain)movies don't have to mean huge CG fights.It could be subtle yet convey a message. The 'Joker' exemplifies this.
It's not perfect though.In my opinion Phoenix was a bit overly done.Don't get me wrong , he's talented ; but he was just trying too hard on this one.Plot holes were many and they just don't correlate well with DC's past.
Cons aside , the movie was assembled well by Todd Phillips and had a spine chilling score from Hildur.
My verdict : A good different movie with a distinctive aura about it.</div>",Positive
381,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I enjoyed it. Some parts of it were weak though, like the opening scene when Arthur gets kicked and robbed by some kids, didn't feel convincing at all. The cinematography was great and the music as well.</div>",Positive
382,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and the film is undeniably fascinating, but the violence is unsettling and leans dangerously close to being irresponsible.</div>",Positive
383,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can see why people are upset and conflicted about the Joker. Can you sympathize with a man at the edge of sanity, who is treated like trash, and who goes full psycho criminal due to the way society deals with him?
At the same time, he is punching holes through the insane inequality of modern societies across the world. Do not think for one second the system some of us hold dear is solid rock. Revolutions have been started by men like Arthur, when his madness reaches out and seems like sanity to the oppressed masses.
This movie shows once again what a genius Joaquim Phoenix is, and should serve as a stark warning to society at large and elites in particular.</div>",Positive
384,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie's portrayal of the Joker character isn't better than the one in Christopher Nolan's film, so why would you reimagine it? Just seems pointless, because Heath Ledger's Joker was so perfectly done that it can't be topped... unless you're just doing it for the money, well then that's just sad.<br/><br/>The movie is a 7.5, which leaves it FAR behind any of the 10/10 Christopher Nolan Batman films.</div>",Positive
385,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a really intense film depicting the myriad of social atrocities the mentally challenged face daily.... Ingeniously!
Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely perfect.... I've always appreciated his expertise and talent, and Joker is even better than most.... He is a REAL actor.
The only suggestion towards our ""Caped life"" being the Wayne family thing and the alley shooting, I wasn't thinking about any of that.... Joaquin had me Joker all the way....his life and pain...
The ending was ""ok,"" I'm looking forward to another Bat film (Vampire Bat...? Really? Pattinson...) including THIS Joker... No offense Jack, this is TOTALLY different... However, may have to get really despicable with Joker... I feel for HIM.....Justice aside!! The ""good vs. evil"" thing, to even WANT to cheer on the Batman.. LOL</div>",Positive
386,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Admittedly I was a few months late to seeing this movie. Am glad to finally say I saw it and regret not seeing it sooner. The movie is more of a character study and Joaquin Phoenix brings a completely new take on the Joker in which the viewer sees Arthur Flecks full descent into madness. I now fully understand the hype and also why Phoenix won the best actor Oscar.</div>",Positive
387,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I felt like this was a unique Joker. At the same time I felt that the previous joker's before him all made a small appearance in his performance. So good!</div>",Positive
388,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""It was a very interesting study of psychology"".
It helped me realize the human brain is a very powerful and magnifying device.</div>",Positive
389,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ultimate analysis of ""Joker"", a confession from a victim to a demon in a mental patient.
This movie is really too dark and depressing.</div>",Positive
390,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin is of course great but Jim carrey would make it blown away.</div>",Positive
391,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like the clown character in the film. As the director has said before, this is a film in the direction of character research and it is experimental. The award of the best film for the joker at the Venice film festival proves the success of the clown character experiment and the quality of the film.</div>",Positive
392,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What will really push a man into hell is to give him an illusion called hope, and then completely destroy it.</div>",Positive
393,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">O. M. G. Joaquin Phoenix, thy name is Joker. The clothes, the make-up, the mannerisms, the mad dancing, the laughter. I never thought it possible to top Heath Ledger's brilliant portrayal of Joker, but Joaquin Phoenix did it. Perhaps it's not fair to make the comparison, but there it is. Joaquin in full bore Joker mode BECAME the Joker. And it was a brilliant touch to attribute his uncontrollable laughter to an actual disorder: the pseudobulbar affect.<br/><br/>I won't belabor. The script, the supporting cast, the musical score, the this, the that, I don't even care. I'll leave that analysis to others. Suffice to say Joaquin Phoenix carried the day. He alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>In a perfect world, this would be done up as a nice, tidy little trilogy.</div>",Positive
394,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Acting was excellent. Overall it is a good movie. There is no spoiler from the very beginning of the movie but at the end it gives a mental satisfaction.</div>",Positive
395,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is not a comic book film. This is no where close to a superhero film. It is a total character study that get dark and deep. This could've been the same movie without the joker and gotham stuff. I am so impressed with what they did in this movie but I think this will be looked back at as film that changed the comic book genre as a whole like a dark knight or Logan.</div>",Positive
396,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After reading so many reviews and so much hype around this movie, was really curious to watch this movie. Trailer looked promising. Movie did not disappoint at all. Great psychological thriller with brilliant acting. Not exactly a masterpiece and certainly not 10/10 but definitely worth between 8 and 9. Lead actor has been absolutely terrific with his acting skills to portray a character with an illness as a result of a brain injury. Expected this movie to be scarier with more intense and gripping scenes to keep audience on the edge. Movie does have some dull moments in between that takes the pace of the movie. Overall a movie worth watching more than once. Face of joker is difficult to forget. Amazing piece of work.</div>",Positive
397,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">DC abandons their Extended Cinematic Universe and attempts to revive the Batman franchise with the indie character drama Joker. The story follows a psychologically disturbed clown named Arthur Fleck who's an aspiring comic as he's fired from his job and gets a shot on a late night talk show after the host riffs on a video of one of Fleck's stand-up routes. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, and Brett Cullen, the film has a pretty decent cast that gives good performances; though Phoenix often overacts, drawing attention to how weird and eccentric he's being for no reason. And the liberal politics are not in any way subtle, overshadowing the plot at time. Still, it does do some interesting things with the Batman mythos and there are some exciting and fun action scenes. Yet while Joker is a novel addition to the Batman franchise, the film style doesn't really feel apiece with the material.<br/><br/>MD ASIK

398,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">He is, by nature, a joker, a witty man with a sense of fun.</div>",Positive
399,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a great film unfortunately I couldn't watch it in the theatre, but never mind.
Character development was excellent all credit goes to good screenplay. Joaquin phoenix performance was unforgettable. But to be honest it wasn't a joker film, it was a journey to become the joker, it was the journey of Arthur fleck. Another point is that the director didn't showed any signs of Arthur being intelligent or have insane IQ as joker possessed tremendous IQ and intelligence. So it was bit difficult to digest that how an abused loner becomes the criminal mastermind of Gotham. Though it was a great experience and I would definately recommend it.</div>",Positive
400,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thank you to Heath Ledger for creating an iconic character into a legend. Due to his master piece acting, filmmakers decided to make a full fledged movie on Arthur Fleck aka #JOKER. Joaquin Phoenix did justice to the character by his acting skills but Nolan's magic was missing in the character. The screen play which was written by Nolan for Joker is unpredictable and surprisingly effective on the other hand Todd Philips' s screen play is not unpredictable but effective and appealing for the audience.This movie would also might get nominated for various categories and might win too. It is a must watch movie for the DC lovers.</div>",Positive
401,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies i have ever watched. It is worth every oenny you spend on it to watch in a theatre. It's start is very slow and sad. And how sometimes our society forces some innocent people to stray towards the dark path unknowingly.
I recommend to watch it. The movie teaches many thing about the world and how it actually works.</div>",Positive
402,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm a bit late on this, but I think the film deserves most of its critical praise. While I have minor gripes, they're nothing to write home about. I personally recommend a watch to new time DC or just Movie fans in general.</div>",Positive
403,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a crime film with ordinary bottom citizens as the protagonists.The film has an excellent atmosphere of Gotham City, dark and wet roads, streets full of garbage, and the atmosphere of a hair-trigger riot.All of this fascinates me.</div>",Positive
404,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jakun's excellent performance and scene design are fascinating, weird, disturbing and frightening. Emotions are like roller coasters, sometimes there are many emotions. It's not a superhero movie. It's a psychological thriller. It's the best movie I've ever seen in character development.</div>",Positive
405,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Our ever-increasing greed, occupancy and fame and fortune have led to a harsh living environment. Not an individual event. This is not God's punishment but our death. Human nature is indeed sinful, and things are not complicated. As a person, his basic needs are not much, and his source of happiness is not much. But materialistic lies engulf most people.
I have no intention of slamming the clown's victimized heart, murder, and the rich's meekness for being rich and benevolent. All of them are victims. They live in the false and unknowing hypocrisy of unconsciousness.
Everyone needs to be redeemed!</div>",Positive
406,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A wondrous performance by Joaquin Phoenix is turned in for Joker, one that was unexpected by me for sure. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is simply because of it's desire to disconnect itself from the comics creating some holes in the potential of the future it hinted at with Batman. The story was good in and of itself and the performance by Phoenix was remarkable, just didn't like a comic book character being used effectively for marketing alone.</div>",Positive
407,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's either a super British movie at all, or a crime movie with ordinary underclass citizens as the main characters, which is probably the most profound analysis of human nature in all of marvel DC's movies in years. Film has a wonderful atmosphere build on Gotham, damp road, streets of rubbish, hair-trigger riots, such an environment, coupled with the miserable life, a bad day, is enough to put an honest poor people into the abyss, from rational kind a little numb and madness, and each step change is believable. Joaquin phoenix's scrawny look is heartache, and there's no doubt that his performance, ""no more clowns after heath ledger,"" is retractable</div>",Positive
408,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film was really good! The acting combined with the screenplay and the audio effects were somewhat unsettling, however, it worked. The tempo of the movie was another positive.</div>",Positive
409,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best performance. This is beauty well writter and produced. Joker is a remarkable drama by WB. Perfect interlink of the play and the crime thriller part.</div>",Positive
410,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phillips must be celebrated for extracting an all-time great performance out of Phoenix. Much of the film frames him in painterly portraits shot by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, highlighting his sorrowful eyes; his distinct features; and the pain on his face as he erupts into involuntary bouts of mirthless laughter. Observe how the camera switches perspective as the film goes on, surrendering its position of superiority as Arthur's transformation takes place. And do not miss the subtle shift in Phoenix's body-language, as he sheds Arthur's skin and slaps on a thick layer of clown makeup</div>",Positive
411,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A rich tapestry of New York is on display here; the film is dripping with grime and production value. Phoenix delivers a tour de force. Bravo!</div>",Positive
412,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved how the movie is made directing, acting, colors, sound track .. everything. I liked the link with Batman.
I see JOKER character from different prospective; he had very poor circumstances but he misread his own story and that is the most depressing part when you start blaming the wrong people and then start blaming everyone and hate everyone for your own decisions and mistakes.
it also draws my attention that the ones who really caused the damage are acts and appears the most helpless ""his mother""</div>",Positive
413,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">FABULOUS FILM. I never thought someone would bring the character of the Joker better than Heath Ledger because his acting work in that movie was one of the best I ever saw. But Joaquin Phoenix proved me wrong, he was sublime in Joker and because of his acting work I fell in love with the movie. The story is really sad but it shows us the story on the side of the Joker like it is never done before. You can also see that Martin Scorsese had influence in this movie, Joker has some resemblances with great Scorsese movies like Taxi Driver and The king of comedy.</div>",Positive
414,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I remembered the first time I saw the character of the joker .. I was fascinated by this character .. Because it's cartoon .. But when I saw Heath Ledger with Nolan .. I saw that filmmakers see this character is more than just an enemy .. My head is Heath Ledger, and I bet Joaquin Phoenix will overtake him. ..And uncomfortable in my seat .. I took out everything in my heart in my discharge to perform Joaquin .. and an early celebration of Oscar deserved to Joaquin .. in short .. Thanks Joaquin</div>",Positive

416,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jauquin is incredible. One of the best films ever in cinematic history. The character development is insane and Todd Phillips does an incredible job at making the audience feel very uncomfortable. I can't really explain the film you have to see it.</div>",Positive
417,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Masterpiece but could be disturbing. a milestone of villain movies.</div>",Positive
418,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Excellent performances all around. Finally a DC movie that doesn't feel like too many ideas being thrown into one movie. Joker is very much a singular cohesive vision that has not a single wasted moment. The back drop of a Gotham city ravaged by wealth inequality sets up the perfect environment for a disturbed character like Joker to emerge as the clown prince of crime. The tax dodging 1% might find this movie ""too controversial"", but this movie is not for them anyways. Highly recommended for comic and non-comic book fans, don't miss this.</div>",Positive
419,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a film! What an actor! I cant believe I'm saying it but this Joaquin Phoenix has now became the best joker there has ever been, I cant put in to words how good this film is and how well it is played, and I dont want to write any spoilers but I advise everyone to give it a watch!</div>",Positive
420,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A truly masterpiece in cinema. With a performance for the ages by Phenoix.</div>",Positive
421,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an intense and well executed film. A true masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix plays the transformation of the main character from a troubled misfit to a master criminal like non other ive seen. It will stand the test of time.</div>",Positive
422,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Todd Phillips does her own story this movie doesnt based in any comic book and joaquin get his first oscar and joaquin is the best thing in the movie but the movie cotain may other unique things like soundtrack
Robert de niro has a beautiful role although he has a few scenes in movie
The end of movie is the best of last 5 years
Finally i hope jaoquin not to play joker agin not in standalone or in batman movies</div>",Positive
423,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was hoping for something good. But it exceeded my expectations! A solid film with a great story to it. Phoenix did such a great job. Loved every minute of it!</div>",Positive
424,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie has such a different perspective towards the legendary character ""Joker"" , it will blow your mind. The dedication of not just Mr. Phoenix but the entire team is just awesome. This movie is not a showcase about who joker is but how joker came into existence. A must watch only in theaters. I just kept 1 star off the rating as i thought it could have a few more plot twists that could have helped the screenplay. All in all no complains. Go watch it today.</div>",Positive
425,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">8 stars if the movie is excellent.
10 stars if the movie is excellent, inspiring, and has a moral.
9 stars if the movie is excellent, tragic, and has a moral.<br/><br/>Every society gets the kind of criminal it deserves. What is equally true is that every community gets the kind of law enforcement it insists on.
Robert Kennedy</div>",Positive
426,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix is masterful as Fleck. He makes the viewer feel his pain and desperation. Though, hard to conceive of his actions and reactions, one sympathizes with Joker and somehow understands why he acts as he does in the movie.</div>",Positive
427,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The guy is strange to begin with and really brings the character of Arthur alive. The whole movie itself is 2h30 of a lot of things wrong with people and our society today. The fact that it's about the Joker character is purely anecdotal for marketing reasons. It could (should?) have been simply called ""Arthur"" and stand on its own immense merits.</div>",Positive
428,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was uncomfortable and I think that was the point.</div>",Positive
429,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A perfect contribution to the most infamous of criminals.. Phoenix is astounding and the storyline carries this as one of the most dominant of the DC movies..</div>",Positive
430,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker origins is a truly remarkable and totally immersive experience. Giving life to this eccentric character, Joaquin Phoenix fills the screen with outlandish movement and crazed laughter only for it to be tempered with majestic poise.
To have the ability to elicit empathy and pity from the audience for a madman is testament to the talents of Director, Todd Phillips, and the lead artist.
Great music score and laughs along the way along with poignancy gives this 2 hour ride all you need for a 9/10</div>",Positive
431,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A filling take on the Joker and a descent into madness.</div>",Positive
432,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story can be get from The Joker Movie is bad people was born from good peoe who are hurt, so we must be good people to everyone</div>",Positive
433,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was expecting another superhero movie but I'm glad I'm not good at guessing. Joaquin Phoenix's mimicry was superb too. Overall I'm very pleased I watched this when it premiered.</div>",Positive
434,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is masterpiece and first of it's kind....Joaquin performance is unbelievable and give the movie different taste ...very recommended</div>",Positive
435,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film, very well directed considering for the director, it wasn't his usual area of expertise.
8.9 would be more accurate.</div>",Positive
436,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie of a lifetime
I think this was the movie that was missing from my life
Earlier when i used to go to the movies the kind of movies i watched had the duration of completeness it can't go any further
But Joker...Woah when the movie ended i was like what i just got there there's gotta be something more every second of this movie is great...the direction of todd philips is beautiful
Phoenix has given the performance , Joker deserves.</div>",Positive
437,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The fact this got a lower critic rating then "" Once upon a time in Hollywood "" shows everything that is wrong with Hollywood and critics, and is a complete ""joke"" pardon the pun. Pheniox deserves an Oscar for his performance.</div>",Positive
438,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Disturbing, realistically dark, and jaw-dropping. Joker pushes all the right buttons to make a cohesive and convincing journey into madness. Psychologically tolling and chilling scenes will take you off your feet
..
Expertly crafted and an ALL TIME performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Todd Phillips really surprised me with his ability to construct a drama/thriller. This movie will go down as the most memorable movie of 2019. Hopefully they expand upon this universe further; it would be nice to see Joaquin helm this character again. Although, this man is an artist, and it doesnt seem in his nature to join a superhero franchise. One can hope though, right? I need to see this film again and again another time to give it my perfect 10 score...I'm on the fence about a 9 or 10 because of some minor gripes that may even disappear with a second viewing. Don't miss this spectacle!</div>",Positive
439,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a great movie do not miss this in a theatrical experience.</div>",Positive
440,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The critics is quick to whack down this movie as empty but it did caught what society had done to this character. it's sad, depressive, with no mental health to help him through his dark period turning to violence as a substitute for drugs and the help he needed. Joaquin Phoenix was good in this dark character and i hope he will be nominated for oscar 2020.</div>",Positive
441,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's great movie and wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix , but the problem is the movie makes you empathizes with joker character and hates Tomas Wyne , and the movie's intention is encouraging violence and criminality.</div>",Positive
442,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While this movie is not a relaxed and easy watch it is a must see. With a haunting performance and well constructed story you will be left satisfied. If you want a ""super hero"" movie this is not it. I would compare it to taxi-driver or you were never really here.</div>",Positive
443,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The anthology of the Joker has always been interesting. This movie took a very human approach to how one of the craziest and demented villains of all time became The JOKER. Incredible acting by Phoenix. He truly was made for this role and interpretation of the Joker. This is a movie that I will love forever but won't need to watch again...yep.</div>",Positive
444,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Each Joker in every film portrays a side that shows the diversity and uniqueness of this character. In third origin we see a dark truth, a real mental depth of what makes the Joker, smile and why he wants to make the world laugh.</div>",Positive
445,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is slow in parts, but builds into the final emotive scenes with great skill and believability. Amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix.
Are villains born that way, or made? The film reveals the latter for this Joker, building piece by piece why he becomes the murderous person of comic book fame. The themes presented, such as mental illness as a complex, multifaceted condition as well as the influence that nurture (or lack thereof) has upon future capacity and happiness are on trend (and believable). I was a bit disappointed by the final portrayal of his mother, as she was also a victim (as no doubt was the perpetrator of the crime that set both mother and son on their bitter and tragic trajectory). Our local newspaper rarely gives 5 star reviews, and the movie did not disappoint. I wanted to riot too! (against the unfairness of a system that tends to fail our most vulnerable.) It is not a new message, but one worth repeating. Thanks to the director, actors, crew and producers.</div>",Positive
446,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is a film that I believe everyone should see at some point in their lives, it doesn't matter when, just once. This is a film that is scarily important and I think it's being criticized for all the wrong reasons. If you're a general fan of film see this film and if you're not see it anyway. Unless you are under the age of 15!</div>",Positive
447,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I came into this screening with v high expectations it was pretty good tbf but bit predictable everyone needs to chill out with thus being their best film of all time. Heath ledger is a better joker but still give phoenix a damn Oscar</div>",Positive
448,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is taken to the next level by the acting skill of Joaquin Phoenix , which is exceptional. The plot of the movie itself was good, His portrayal of the Joker has some simularities with his protrayal of commodus in the Gladiator.
In both cases, the characters, commit evil crimes, but still you sympathize , because he plays them as such tragic figures. For Commodus he deserved an Oscar and didn't get it, for the Joker he deserves an Oscar, and I sincerely hope he gets it.</div>",Positive
449,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only reason I didn't rate it for 10 stars is that there were some really slow scenes that made me lose focus.</div>",Positive
450,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great movie, great acting, unpredictable, and a pure masterpiece. The only small, compliant I have is the riot scene was a little ridiculous.</div>",Positive
451,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker was and is the best Anti-hero Villian of all times. Pheonix's potrayal of the Joker was mere perfect. When you feel sympathetic with a villian, you know how good of a characterisation was done. Only thing I would say negative about the movie was the support cast which was a let down.</div>",Positive
452,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many of us, who watched the iconic Joker play of Heath Ledger were trying to compare it with play of Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. One can try to witness those ""elegant madness"" of Joker character- see craziness in his eyes, laugh, confidence, joy of killing; and I want to see it all, all at once, like in ""The Dark Knight"" movie.
Through the whole movie, I was waiting for that moment... And now, seems like he found a chance for revenge, he puts his hands on the wall, lowers his head, and BUM; that's it, ohh, that look. But... next we see a man, who is crazy, but it's the illness, it made him to be this, all those circumstances, society; so real, too real for my taste. Why not going further, why not putting that spark in his eyes? I don't want to feel sad for him, I want to feel angry, excited and not believe how he can laugh at the end.
Play was good, but all I wanted is that crazy Joker, and I am getting a real man. Is it something you want also? I don't know, and it shouldn't be. Nevertheless, you will like this movie for sure.</div>",Positive
453,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A worthy standalone that grips firmly on both modern day issues and somehow, a realistic comic character's origin story.</div>",Positive
454,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix for many many years and have seen him jump headfirst into many complex characters but he goes above and beyond here. This is possibly his best performance to date and yes he definitely deserves an Oscar for his work.<br/><br/>But does him deserving the Oscar make him better than Heath? If you compare Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger your denying yourself the chance to see the film clearly, both of them are the best at the joker they brought to the party.<br/><br/>The fact this came from the direction of the director that brought us the hangover is amazing because it's possibly the best dive into mental health in film history.<br/><br/>Definitely go see this, for Joaquins performance alone it's well worth it.</div>",Positive
455,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning, chilling portrayal of the Joker. He put his own spin on it and it is completely mesmerizing. This movie completely left me speechless in the same way Silence of the Lambs did the first time I watched it. Phillips should win best Director. The score should also win. The supporting performances were all good.</div>",Positive
456,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Film of the year so far. The feeling of impending dread runs throughout and is aptly aided by the amazing soundtrack.
Mr Phoenix puts in a truly mesmerising performance and deserves another crack at the character in any upcoming Bat film.
Ace</div>",Positive
457,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't know much about this film except that it was the jokers backstory. Amazing acted by Joaquin Pheonix. He show his vulnerable side at the start when nothing seems to go right for him then we see his development into the joker.</div>",Positive
458,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's good to see a movie that present the perspectives of the mentally ill and poor people. And the final scene was just top notch. Heath would have been proud.</div>",Positive
459,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching the first version of the trailer I was a little bit sceptical, then I've seen a new one and decided to give it a try. Despite a hype going all over the place, it was the best decision so far. This movie is truly something else. Those 2 hours went like nothing. However, I was expecting a longer ending to mark the beauty and madness of the story simultaneously. It's not an action movie, it's all about the story.</div>",Positive
460,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like it.👏what the Film describes,happens everyday and nobody see it</div>",Positive
461,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is a fantastic piece of social commentary that somehow manages to drive forward a comic character while subtly pointing out the flaws in todays society, despite it being set in a universe based in our equivalent of the early 1980s. Not a perfect movie, but definitely worthy of a 9/10</div>",Positive
462,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfect movie !</div>",Positive
463,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was phenomenal. I walked in as a Psych major knowing that it would be very intense and very dark. A lot of reviews say it's ""too disturbing"". I find these comments are most likely from people who do not understand mental health disorders. I think they are possibly the viewers that this movie is trying to reach out to. The premise teaches the audience what it is like to be someone with a mental disorder in today's society. The mistreatment, abuse (verbal and physical) and overall lack of sympathy. It also focuses on the mental health system, counselors and pharmaceuticals alike that show what happens when someone can no longer receive the help they need. This is exactly what happens, and Arthur begins to spiral, and yet, he thinks he is okay. This movie had me wrapped in it the entire two hours and had me focused on mental health awareness AND had me fangirling. Worth the watch. Maybe bring a friend, though!</div>",Positive
464,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As if made to understand, but the Joker is still the Joker. No matter how deep we try to understand, it is very difficult to understand. The Joker tries to get us to stand in his perception. Do not be surprised if in a few moments, you want to defend everything he does. But also don't be surprised if after realizing all that, you feel that you have been tricked by Arthur's thoughts.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips cleverly takes us round and round to see the Joker from various sides, without us knowing. Combined with the skill of acting three times the nominee Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix plays a mimic, do not expect by watching the Joker you will be able to understand the contents of his head.</div>",Positive
465,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! Joaquin Phoenix done his best and given a wonderful performance in this movie for the clown prince of crime.</div>",Positive
466,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A brilliant story that makes Joker a human character. Extremely Mad, But Human ... A Magnificent Interpretation of Joaquin Phoenix, that Deserves the Oscar for the Best Actor</div>",Positive
467,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Enough has been written about the movie being worth all the hype. So I'll not go much into it. This is a truly remarkable cinematic work. What stood out most sharply for me was how Todd Phillips painted the picture of Joker - it wasn't at all simplistic, but the complexity is never too labouring for the audience. And his genius actor, Joaquin Phoenix rises above possibly all his expectations to complete a near perfect show! Whether Academy gives the Best Actor to him or not, he's already a winner in all of our hearts. He was phenomenal, I could sense everyone in the audience could feel his pain. And not to mention the costume, set design, camera work and brilliant score. Violence in the movie is absolutely necessary and very tastefully done. Last but not the least, the story is set in the 60s or 70s Gotham City but its message &amp; violence are well adapted to today's hate-filled world. Without a doubt, the best movie this year! 9/10.</div>",Positive
468,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think this movie was great because this movie is about a guy with a mental illness like many people in our world has and this show us that we need to take care or to like see them and don't be mean to them</div>",Positive
469,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Direction is great. Background scores adds the soul to it. Acting is no doubt about it. But the ending should have been done when joker rises when he smears his face with blood.</div>",Positive
470,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Edgy, dynamic and on point. Cinema to re-enjoy and over.</div>",Positive
471,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was better than I even expected, and I expected it to be very good. A must see even if you are not a fan of comic book movies. It's great cinema.</div>",Positive
472,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is a best origin for joker and joaquin phoneix is surely getting oscar.The movie is bind with good acting,story and humour also dancing 😂😂😂just kidding. This movie is must watch for everyone even you are marvel fan because iam a marvel fan too .This movie is perfect but iam demarking a mark because of we need joker and batman together again on a big screen</div>",Positive
473,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie highlights on how a society can turn a person with special needs to a monster. It is deep in the message. Never underestimate kind and weak people and treat them back badly. They can be something else if exploded. ""Be the change you want to see in the World""</div>",Positive
474,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin was amazing for that role, and the history its so real</div>",Positive
475,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is trapped in his own inability (wants to stand up comedian, but he lacks the talent / and he laughs real and spurious always in the wrong place).
Because of the bad times in Gotham and his own terrible past and present, what he had become and will become later, seems partly understandable. And that is the point:
It is the realism of this gotham world and its joker and his helpless obsessive dealing with that world that captivate you to the very last minute.</div>",Positive
476,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just one thing... One little thing: ""Why so serious?"". I wish I could hear that at least for once. Then I could give 10/10 for this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
477,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will admit I was completely against a origin story about the greatest villain of all time.
""Why, when the mystery of who he really is makes him that much more"".<br/><br/>A film is hangs on its writers.
If you don't have a solid script then you don't have anything even with billions behind it
eg: Justice League.
That said, not a scene nor piece of dialog wasted which is rare.
Even a person not knowing anything about Batman could watch this film and just enjoy it for what it is.
A great film</div>",Positive
478,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just incredible the acting, the dialogues, the cinematography everything is just beyond ordinary</div>",Positive
479,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is amazing in many ways... Joaquin Phoenix is a strange, but an amazing actor and he fits the role as the joker perfect. The plot is very original and well written. I want to point out, that if u are looking for an action movie like the avengers, then the Joker is not for your cup of tea. Its a slow pace movie, with a high climax in the end.</div>",Positive
480,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix has beautifully portrayed his feelings and emotions throughout the movie. His performance is what highlights the movie the most.</div>",Positive
481,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">(No spoiler)
If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action, forget it... This movie demands some patience and criticism to be properly appreciated and enjoyed.
Besides that, in my opinion, it was a complete success and I think it let some questions in the air during the movie.
But the main lesson to take from this movie is definitely that we should stop judging others too much, instead, we should put ourselves in their position. It deals with a mental disease and shows us that the way we see things depend so much on our position.
The main actor was just Excellent!
I would definitely recommend.</div>",Positive
482,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">They presented the Joker in the best way possible, and the explained the real way how Bruce Wayne parents how did they really die, I hope this joker sticks for two many movies to come.<br/><br/>^_^</div>",Positive
483,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw the movie Joker for the second time this weekend and I loved it even more than the first. Joker takes everyone's understanding of what a comic book movie is and flips it on its head. Telling the story from a true bad guys perspective and letting you sit in his mind for two hours leaving you to question what is real and what was a lie just has stuck with me. The movie isn't perfect, the ending seemed like they need to explain the point at the end and that it wasn't about supporting what he did. However, the film took my biggest fear about the movie and proved me wrong. I was worried that the film would try to be a Marvel movie and try to stay in that cookie-cutter mold, but the film stayed true to what the Joker is.</div>",Positive
484,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you watch Joker in a theater and you see a fat neckbeard with a Punisher T-Shirt, a large duffle bag and clown makeup, then that's just how our society is.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
No but seriously it's pretty good. The only problems with it are a few plot holes which can be solved by juts saying it didn't happen but that's frankly just a cop out.</div>",Positive
485,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best Batman movie ever!
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>",Positive
486,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have been a fan of the character for about 27 years (30 years old)...
Amazing, amazing, amazing...
The main character... The plot... The timing... The light... Simply amazing...
Huge recommendation to any Batman/Joker fan (especially Joker fans...)...<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it 9 stars is because Heath's is still my favourite... But by a single hair :)<br/><br/>I think I smell an Oscar</div>",Positive
487,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely the best performance of the year that I've seen so far, Joaquin Phoenix killed it. This spiraling horror of a plot did a show us why the Joker is who he is. A man whose psychological condition and bad upbringing created a horrific anti-hero. AND the dark cinematography, story, acting all worked exceptionally well.</div>",Positive
488,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Aesthetically pleasing well-crafted movie, refreshingly entertaining, homage to old school, fun, sometimes even smart. Score is amazing and smartly integrated into scenes and Phoenix is playing role of his life. This certainly belongs to the top of this year's production.</div>",Positive
489,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I used to think that my life was a tragedy, and now I realize that it is a comedy. ''I think too much, or the world is getting more crazy!'' The system silently solidifies the social class, the so-called upper layer never notices their existence, making fun of them, everyone is just an incompetent clown, but When the clowns really turned into joker, Arthur was forced to face the chaos, the most common individual in the society without a trace, but when he saw himself and everything, it showed the coming of destruction. It is the so-called elites who attacked and ridiculed the top of the elite to start the Shura field of the slaughter! Even if they don't know what the reason for what they are doing, the killing has come. Here is my life. I am not sure if I really exist in my life. But I am very sure now, everyone is starting to notice me! So smile ! Why so serious?</div>",Positive
490,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only issue with the joker cause .. the world which pushed him to madness won't hear his scream , Gotham is beyond saving</div>",Positive
491,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Recent years the social development are continue develop into a sure wired fact, rich people get richer and poor people get poor. Joker do show the difference between poor people and rich. The conflicts between level are getting much serious ever before.</div>",Positive
492,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely amazing!<br/><br/>They should skip the oscars for actor in lead role and just give the award to Joaquin Phoenix. What a performance!</div>",Positive
493,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">All the people giving this low reviews probably weren't expecting an actual art piece. Granted, given that it's supposed to be about the DC comic universe, I could see how they would have went into it expecting that, and can understand the disappointment.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen Taxi Driver? No? Go watch it. Did you like it? Watch this.<br/><br/>Only reason I didn't give it a ten is because of some plot holes and some predictable ""twists"", and because it could have been about virtually any other character besides the Joker and have been the same film. I'm not really a big fan or detractor of comic-book based movies, so I'd imagine I'd have stronger feelings about it one way or the other if I were. I pretty much forgot that it had anything to do with Batman for most of the movie.</div>",Positive
494,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An emotionally intense movie. Joaquin Phoenix was made for this role. He was flawless. My only critique is that I felt the suspense was high right from the start, and as the movie progressed, the intensity continued to rise. I was wanting it all to come together sooner, so I felt the movie dragged on a little bit.</div>",Positive
495,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As all around the world The Movie ""Joker"" was released and everybody talking about the movie , i was just take a neep and wait for my pleasure time for watching this because from the beginning i knew it would be a greatest performance of all time by Joaquin Phoenix , This is the real Joker of Gotham city ,Best performance by Joaquin Phoenix ,I wish he could Win the best actor award by Oscar's</div>",Positive
496,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix is committed. There is not another performance this year that even comes close to what he did here. Such a fresh, though dark, take on a story that's been told a million times. In the age of serial killers and social media manipulation this film is both timely and prophetic. The main complaint from people was that is was not a superhero movie. That there aren't any special effects or fights with his traditional enemies. This is an origin story. There is no reason for all of that. This movie is epic.</div>",Positive
497,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A hauntingly beautiful masterpiece, that will keep you guessing at all turns of the story. The unpredictable and horrific charm of the Joker keeps you enraptured in a trance. Joaquin Phoenix shines bright like a diamond, owning the role and delivering something unparalleled. An amalgam of incredible cinematography, profound dialogues, well depicted themes and mystifying music, creates magic. The Joker will win your hearts and steal your breath away.</div>",Positive
498,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Superb individual mental sacifice to attain such a mindset to produce this absorbing portrayal of an otherwise secondary character (barring Heath Ledgers awesome reflection) into a performance that reflects easily such pain and suffering of a segment of society whose only wish is to make others smile to gain their own sense of worth.</div>",Positive
499,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No words, just emotions. Recommended for viewing!!</div>",Positive
500,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I guess there are 2 experiences. One with never seeing Taxi Driver and one with seeing Taxi Driver. This is probably why most of the top reviews come from younger people who never saw Taxi Driver. That being said, it's a great movie and Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor.</div>",Positive
501,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I gave 9 points. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. The performance is too emotional. It expresses pain with an uncontrollable giggling. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. In fact, it is a very serious film, including paying attention to social issues. The movie is kind of evil and will make you feel a little sympathy for this clown. In addition, this film should not be sequel and derivative, because it is still too real, if the character is re-comicized, it will no longer be him.</div>",Positive
502,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film no doubt was the best film ever made on such a great theme of social reclusion and challenges which the society is facing since its inception. The main actors of the film were amazing and phoenix was the one carried this film and its success to extreme. A great film to understand the real problem in todays society.</div>",Positive
503,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A film tailored for cultural researchers.I love it!!!</div>",Positive
504,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am the only one who wanted him to be more ""bad""? Haha</div>",Positive
505,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An amazing take on the most notorious villain 'Joker'. Phoenix is a true Phoenix. He rises every time from his own ashes.</div>",Positive
506,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everyone should watch a movie like this. What a concept that is very very new one</div>",Positive
507,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would of never expected a joker movie but i loved it Joaquin Phoenix was perfect for the role and a lot better than Jared Leto. In this film i hope i wasn't the only one who felt bad for Arthur Fleck, throughout the film i couldn't stop feeling sympathy apart from when he when murdered what i would now is the next film to be called ""Batman"" and I pray that it will be as good as this film</div>",Positive
508,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved joker as a character for a long time before I love this movie. I loved the actor who played the joker in this movie. They made he loved joker as a character even more. He did a great job. I love how the ending of the movie tied into the Batman movies. That was a nice touch. I loved the joker personality in this movie. I liked that they brought in mental health and how that can affect people. But I don't have mental illness of any kind of I don't know if it was really good or if it me thinking they do a good job. I loved all the emotions, characters, characters development, storyline and plot. They did a really good job on it all. The did a good job with telling this story and how he got to where he got. I highly recommend this story to everyone no matter what.</div>",Positive
509,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a story about joker, a famous evil in the ""Batman"".
In that movie, He is described as a ""bad man"" who disturb public order and kill a lot of people, with being contrasted to the hero who stars protagonist.
However in this movie, we can notice that he is usually unusual man.
We can encounter or communicate such person as him in our everyday life, furthermore we can act or be as him, if background was little different from now.
Because of these factor, we can sympathize him at the same time feeling scared to be the victim or perpetrator who is hated as joker in card-game.</div>",Positive
510,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Quite a movie to watch. Awesome acting and outstanding character. A real life situation movie related to all the happenings around us.</div>",Positive
511,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The performance was outstanding.. the complex character the difficulty to accurately convey the illness is phenomenal.</div>",Positive
512,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Is it too much to ask for respect? After watching the movie, I felt the primary question was this being posed by the movie. The society represented is basically a 'dead society' (at least for me it was), wherein people barely have the time to spare to help an individual whose only source of income is slipping away. It's a world where the roots of such comedy reality shows are being ignored. I felt as if the movie was also trying to make a point on how people rarely spend time on introspection that is much needed now a days.<br/><br/>The movie's cinematography and the content were hand in hand. Imbued with violence and gloominess, the narrative speaks a lot to the viewers.</div>",Positive
513,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was taught put on smile on face always but the world is a crazy joke.</div>",Positive
514,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have to admit that Joker is a work of art in terms of director's style, camera lens language, actor's performance and screenplay and story weaving, which is worth making a deep impression in the film history.</div>",Positive
515,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great movie, i love it, amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, stunning!!!</div>",Positive
516,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Through the eyes of this famous villain in the DC comics, I seem to understand better that the real world is sometimes really disappointing</div>",Positive
517,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant perfomance and very good screen play like that very much</div>",Positive
518,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Incredible movie, the score is absolutely brilliant and the plot is extremely well written. A very, very dark movie, but also an incredibly well made movie. I don't think I looked away from the screen once because it was so engaging.</div>",Positive
519,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phenomenal . I thought that this Joker recieved all the hype as promtion because of the new potrayal by Joaquin Phoenix but I was completely wrong. It lived up to the hype and surpass it with ease. I like the simplicity and deliberate scenes they had it was extremely though out and exceptionally acted by Joaquin. I can just imagine the physical and mental toll he must of took to play this brilliant Joker. Everything from the laugh ,the pain , suffering,the back story , and all the internal emotions he dealt with made this Joker fell more real . It brought everyone watching into his world , from his perspective as a movie should. This well depicted movie shows that you don't need over the top cinematography , CGI and soundtracks to have tremendous impact . It all came down to the story and it's execution by characters which were superb by both Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro 🙌👏👍🤘Would definitely recommend this masterpiece of cinema 9/10</div>",Positive
520,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">People's evil is not born from nature, but the things in life, let them give up the original belief and value of human nature.</div>",Positive
521,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a crime movie with ordinary low-level citizens as the main characters. It's probably the most profound one among all the movies of Marvel DC in recent years. The film creates an excellent atmosphere for Gotham City, with dark and humid roads, garbage filled streets, and a sense of impending violence. Such an environment, coupled with a tragic life experience and a bad day, is enough to force an honest poor man into the abyss, turning a little bit from rational goodness to numbness and madness, and every step of transformation is authentic. Jackun Phoenix's bony appearance is heartbreaking. There is no doubt that the movie's King level performance, ""no clown after Heath Ledger"" can be taken back.</div>",Positive
522,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""What kind of a coward would do something that cold- blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask. Someone who is envious of those more fortunate than themselves, yet they're too scared to show own face.And until all those kind of people change for the better... those of us who've made something of our lives,will always look at those who haven't as nothing but clowns.""</div>",Positive
523,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought it moved a little slowly at first but once he went full Joker it was on!</div>",Positive
524,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boy! I tell you, I had very little expectations and I caught myself almost standing up and clapping for such an amazing movie. I'm sure it's the start of a string of movies. It's a fresh introduction for comic book fans and newcomers alike. You're captivated in the eyes and mind of the protagonist who's known to me an iconic antagonist. However, because of his actions and the settling ambience portrayed in this film, you're caught wanting more and actually applauding his motives. It's the perfect psychological drama film that's more than just a origin story, it's a masterpiece! Far beyond my expectations and hopes for such film.</div>",Positive
525,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Note: I'm a fairly hardcore Batman fan. I'm not sure if that sways my rating or not, but several of my superhero-hating friends also thought it was scarily enjoyable.<br/><br/>Joker was somehow exactly what I hoped it would be but also totally shattered my expectations, and both of those are extremely high bars for an avid Batman fan like myself. The first half caused me to simultaneously feel deeply rooted sympathy and repulsion for the most illogical of man's creatures, which is again quite the accomplishment. For the entire second half, my heart never stopped pounding out of my chest, and I was fighting back nervous laughter at how horribly perfect everything was. This movie made me feel the closest I've ever felt with the Joker, which was a scary and beautiful experience.</div>",Positive
526,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is pheneonal. It left me with dread and satisfaction that I didn't thought was possible. When the movie was announced, I was pretty skeptical but this proved me so wrong.I adore this movie. Brilliant.</div>",Positive
527,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an amazing performance by Joaquin, I'm
A big fan of his and when he didn't win the Oscar for Walk the Line I literally cried. He is a real actor, his devotion to the craft is incredible.</div>",Positive
528,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This should do for prequels what GODFATHER 2 did for sequels, and it needs to be said that the movie itself is just as fine as its celebrated star's performance. Though it surely will not make the kind of money Marvel kiddie-crap usually strives for, this violent journey into the dark side of mental illness seems geared toward satisfying more adventurous audiences. So leave the kids and impressionable teens at home, and take a walk on the wild side with Mr. Phoenix through these very dark, very mean streets of Gotham.</div>",Positive
529,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When i saw this movie in the early 10 minutes, i know this movie is brilliant. The actors, drama, violent and joke is best for me. Best movie have i ever seen. The ending is blur make the viewer asking what is the joker generally.</div>",Positive
530,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is a alarm call to think about madness, modern life and social discomfort. That kind of topic, just in this moment of our history, with that excellent level of acting is a 10/10. But taking in account the power to call a massive volume of spectators (searching for superhero movies) is simply awesome. We need this kind of stories today, and also on main stream.</div>",Positive
531,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ledgers Joker will stand as one of the greatest performances in a film of all time. The real Joker in Phoenix IS THE JOKER. Pure masterpiece. Absolute insanity and joy and sincerity. My favorite film of all time and the GREATEST origin story of a villian of all time. Marvel you HAVE been beaten in this category. Phoenix MUST win Oscar. Film should be film of the year. Absolute masterpiece.</div>",Positive
532,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix performance is magnificent!! No words to describe it, the acting, the scenography, the directing are a masterpiece of art!!</div>",Positive
533,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautiful movie. Amazing acting by joaquin pheonix.</div>",Positive
534,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At first what seemed to just be a sad movie turned into a deep peeling back of who the man behind the name was. This is probably one of the best acting to date by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of what one would expect from a villain is beyond what I expected. At times depressing, at times comical, at times crazy, violent and twisted, it had a great balance of all of these. Great storyline, superb acting and awesome cinematography.</div>",Positive
535,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie exceeded all expectations! Even if you're not a comic book fan and don't know who the joker is, this is a great suspenseful movie seeing a man slowly fall into insanity. Joaquin Phoenix Puts shows his method acting at its best and will leave you with your jaw on the floor. Absolutely incredible movie and with the movie ticket!</div>",Positive
536,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is the beast movie of cómic gender in history if you want to put it in that gender because os just art is art without subgenders os just perfect, Joaquín Phoenix is astonishing os crazy is the beat joker in cinema</div>",Positive
537,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautiful and incredible the movie... I hope to get the oscar</div>",Positive
538,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movie I have seen in a lot time what really brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He deserves to win a Oscar for real good job with this wonderful film.</div>",Positive
539,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the greatest films I have ever watched.</div>",Positive
540,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Awesome atmosphere, casting, story, cinematography, editing...</div>",Positive
541,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Acting and directing at max level! Lets hope that it will not be a sequel</div>",Positive
542,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin's sublime performance, the director Todd Phillips manages to plant the natural essence of the quebno joker is just fighting with batman, is all that happens so that it reaches total madness and creates a symbol of strength against the rich</div>",Positive
543,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A message for the times. When the truth is suppressed chaos follows.</div>",Positive
544,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First, joaquin demonstrates the best acting i've ever seen in any sort of cinema. the character development feels so natural and not rushed. although joaquin's performance is the highlight of the movie; it doesn't take away from the beautiful cinematography and surprisingly really good camera work. lastly, the score is so tragically beautiful and joaquin only makes the score even more haunting.</div>",Positive
545,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The beat cómic movie ever. Fantástico performance, make me feel the character into the bone.</div>",Positive
546,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie compelled me to leave a review because it was that riveting... There isn't much to say. The movie left me speechless and I pray DC continues down this path... coming from a hardcore Marvel fan. Unbelievable performances across the board. 10/10. Two thumbs up.<br/><br/>Warning: This movie is legitimately uncomfortable to watch.</div>",Positive
547,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was spectacular, but the acting....the acting was superb. Phoenix did absolutely amazing.</div>",Positive
548,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Todd Phillip's masterpiece ""Joker"" brings us into the mind of a haunted and twisted man named Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix truly captivates this horrific character and gives us a disturbing, Oscar worthy performance. While watching the film I never thought of this person as Phoenix but instead I was convinced that I was watching the tribulations of the deeply troubled Arthur Fleck. Phillip's camerawork was surprisingly amazing in this film as well. There are amazing shots in the film that not only show the bleakness of the worn down streets of Gotham City but also slowly reveal Fleck's decent into madness. Don't believe the critics saying not to see it because this film is amazing.</div>",Positive
549,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the BEST movies of my life. Joaquin Phoenix's best work 😍
Loss of words!!!!!!!!!!
Must watch</div>",Positive
550,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is awesome, maybe DC is gonna rise above marvel now</div>",Positive
551,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is definitely movie of the year by a long stretch, phoenix gives his best performance so far, the story and directing is first class, plenty of awards to come for this one,
Can't rate it highly enough even if you aren't a DC fan or the genre in general it's a great thriller in its own right.</div>",Positive
552,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">They managed to show Joker's life with full of misery and comedy. When you look at point of view of Joker, you beginning to give right to what Joker stand for and did for. I heavily recommend you to watch this piece of mesmerizing film.</div>",Positive
553,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes ladies and gentlemen; the oscar is his. I am totally blown away by the screenplay, soundtrack and everything in this film. Hands out to the best director</div>",Positive
554,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With a magnificent performance of the daunting character that is the joker, Phoenix manages to capture the transformation of his character perfectly and with great effect. Perhaps the best movie revolving around DC characters since the Nolan trilogy.</div>",Positive
555,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Outstanding Master Piece Truly Captures Mental Health Showing How Dark It Is</div>",Positive
556,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Extremely sick and autistic work i just love it and recommend watching this peice of art.</div>",Positive
557,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think this hews closer to the Joker in the comics. Ledger's Joker was pretty good, but so so very smart. This one is just..Joker. Very good helming by director. I'm sure the editing and sounds will also get a nod in the Oscars. It's good they have De Niro there. The style of filming and setting of the film follows one of his classics. There was a subplot there that didn't pan out I don't if it was in the comics, but that would have a good source material for another Batman edition. And of course, Phoenix got his craft down in this movie. Character development 👌🏽 Warning: this is a serious film!</div>",Positive
558,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Felix has done an incredible job as joker. His emotions were better than the previous jokers DC has given to us. The movie's first half is full of sorrows but still has good stiry element.
I would recommend everyone to watch it. It may not be interesting as End game, but it's something that marvel can't do.</div>",Positive
559,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The soundtrack, the acting, the plotline, the tension, EVERYTHING perfectly mixing together in harmony. Todd Philips' proves it in his masterpiece called Joker. and who knows this movie will the next best picture that would be announced in the next Academy Award.</div>",Positive
560,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is unapologetically raw and satisfyingly shocking. Being a iconic villain you couldn't help but be sympathetic towards him and that's the beauty of this film. Every single expression of Phoenix screams Joker. He was hauntingly magnificent, you just can't take your eyes off him. An awestruck performance that will haunt your thoughts for days!<br/><br/>Heath Ledger would be so proud.</div>",Positive
561,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When this movie was announced I said it was a stupid idea. I was very wrong. This movie is bone chilling right from the start. The story, the picture, the character, the sound, everything about this movie is done so very well, it is a true masterpiece. Easily one of the best movies I have seen. Full of powerful moments and surprises, no stones left unturned. Although fictional, is an eye opener to mental health, and relates well to the real word in some aspects. I agree that it should not be compared to endgame, however I will compare it to the dark knight for being such a high quality movie that is not overly far fetched and very engaging, I will also compare it to breaking bad for how well it tells a story (just relax if you disagree with that)</div>",Positive
562,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Terrific performance of Joaquin Phoenix , delivering a thrilling suspense from the beginning until the end. Bravo!</div>",Positive
563,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not just a movie but a journey from no one to the most iconic villain of all time. Phoenix gives an oscar worthy performance, a true justice to Batman's arch nemesis.</div>",Positive
564,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films I've seen, so we'll done. Joaquin Pheonix is amazing, a really great actor</div>",Positive
565,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Me speaking about the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix, or the surprising work of the director Todd Phillips will not be that of an importance, many people have spoken about it already, and it needs no prove for we all know it's the best movie for the last 5 years at least, if not, at least the best actor, do not listen to those who wanna ruin a good movie for you.
People find it hard to understand that THIS IS JUST MOVIE, it's a work of art, it's uneven to control it, a work of a director is to make art, he is not responsible for teaching people how they should perceive the movie
Movies are the window of our imagination, as humans we have the capacity of feeling so many emotions that we do not have a chance in our life right now to feel, and art is the gateway for all our fantasies, it has nothing to do with the real world, the movie is about a BAD PERSON, we all know that, so we must cut the nonsense and enjoy the art that is this movie.</div>",Positive
566,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As we watch Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck pass trought the Gotham's raw and rude reality, we can also feel his development, a deep and brutal script and actor achievement.</div>",Positive
567,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin phoenix has produced a performance of a life time.A MUST SEE in theatres.Probably the best movie of the year and Oscar Worthy.Best Character development i have seen in a movie.</div>",Positive
568,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is probably the best film I have seen, it is very beautifully filmed and well written. I like that it is very inspired by Scorsese's gritty 70s crime dramas (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, ect...) and the odd humour definitely has One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest vibes. Although it is dark and disturbing it is still a very beautiful and melancholy film. Joaquin Phoenix did a great and complex portrayal of mental health and the Joker. I'm expecting the film to win some Oscars this year.
Joker is true cinema.</div>",Positive
569,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great movie exhibiting many dark sides of society. Great acting loved every bit of it.</div>",Positive
570,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Anyone who saying this movie is dangerous and perpetuates violence doesn't see the real meaning and true story of this movie. This movie is so deep and profound and it's a concentrated version of the world when you really think about it. This movie is amazing. Joaquin was phenomenal. Cinematically the film was perfect. Storyline was so good. Made you feel real wmotions. Made you feel sorry for him. As you should</div>",Positive
571,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An exceptional performance from Joaquin (I will lose faith in the oscars if he doesn't win best actor for this!) and an incredible unfolding story with a poignancy that different people will reflect on different ways. For me, it reinforced my belief that the vulnerable in society need support, care and love. When we neglect this duty, the results can be horrendous</div>",Positive
572,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The acting dedication that has been presented by Joaquin in joker will last and respected for ever.<br/><br/>Unforgettable performance.</div>",Positive
573,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Holy ****. This is hands down the best film of the year so far! Phoenix was made to play this role, the character is so unsettling and his demonic laugh will stay with you. In the dark knight, Heath Ledger was playing the joker. However, in this film, Phoenix is playing as Arthur Fleck. This is a new type of joker we have never seen before and is just as crazy as the Ledger Joker, if not more. The film manages to maintain the tension throughout the run time and also has some scenes you'll never forget. The movie is very controversial, but I feel that it was made to be like that.</div>",Positive
574,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An Absolute MASTERPIECE. Joaquin pheonix gave an UNREAL PERFORMANCE</div>",Positive
575,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fantastic. The performance from Phoenix was just outstanding. Congratulations.</div>",Positive
576,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Slow, watchful and an amazing evolution of a villain who is wonderfully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>He embraces the role and owns it. Robert De Niro packs in a powerful performance as well.<br/><br/>A Movie worth watching with an open perspective. Here's to a best picture and best actor nomination. No Doubt</div>",Positive
577,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am blown away, completely blown away by this film. I mean this is what cinematography is all about: creating an alternative world, so realistic you immediately feel like you are there. Im not gonna repeat the many people who wrote earlier. But what i am going to say is that if Joaquin does not get an Oscar for it, then Oscars must be cancelled! His performance was absolutely mind-blowing. The whole movie: the costumes, music, decorations, screenplay, direction - literally everything is flawless. You cannot better it in any way.</div>",Positive
578,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Truly a masterpiece. There was no other way this could have been portrayed, just simply perfection. A beautiful telling that easily leads into the Dark Knight trilogy and Heath's joker.</div>",Positive
579,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker is impressive. I recommend it 100%.</div>",Positive
580,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best movies you will ever see. It will leave you wondering. Masterpiece in every aspect.
The director was brilliant in breaking the tension to the audience with in between comedy lines.</div>",Positive
581,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A new view of the clown prince of crime, stunning performance Phoenix!</div>",Positive
582,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An outstanding and amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.</div>",Positive
583,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Words could not justify the greatness of this masterpiece. Go watch every unique second of it and immerse yourself to epic cinematography.</div>",Positive
584,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A total masterpiece
acting
music
joaquin just nailed it!
theres no better joker than this
i definitely deserves all the awards he can get
for me and as i can see this is the movie of the year and sure it is!</div>",Positive
585,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such an amazing act..
It makes you fell sorry about him and for another time that you must never judge someone before you know the truth from both sides..
It is a movie that sure deserves an Oscar..</div>",Positive
586,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of those rare movies that is able to linger in your head for a long time. The descent of the joker into madness was truly something to behold. This movie is less so a super hero story but more a study of human psyche and how dark it could be. A work of art that should not be missed .</div>",Positive
587,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No. You can't extract the lunacy in someone not much more than this.</div>",Positive
588,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have just witnessed a masterpiece of an acting! I can't remember the last time I've seen a performance like that. The movie was well written, brilliantly directed and would like to see it once again!</div>",Positive
589,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Could honestly say it's one of the, if not THE, best marvel/dc films I've seen. You're able to care for Arthur and feel so much stress and worry for him within a few moments of the opening scene. About an hour into the film I felt it was mine numbingly depressing and needed something big to happen within the story to engage me.<br/><br/>Well I was not left disappointed when the intense last half an hour had the same epic feel that you get when watching Christopher Nolan's last 2 batman instalments. I was left wanting to stand up and clap the film for its excellence. The director and Joaquin Phoenix were able to fill me with 100 different types of emotion and help me to remember the feeling I felt when I read ""The End"".</div>",Positive
590,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is dark and slow and purposeful... that does not disappoint.</div>",Positive
591,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.. this is how DC should make movies not try to make movies like marvel... Joaquin did a marvellous job and deserves a Oscar.. Todd Phillips did a amazing direction.. cinematography and music is also top notch.. best dc movie just like dark knight...</div>",Positive
592,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker, like it or not is political... and he is the hero we all deserve. Phoenix is inspiring but the Joker is motivational.</div>",Positive
593,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wtf is this man yaar he is lit whaaaat a movie is this man a boooooom movie</div>",Positive
594,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix plays the best role of his career so far, and makes the character come alive. What is a well known fictional character from DC comics becomes a portrayal of a more realistic and altogether credible character on the big screen.
The plot weaves nicely into existing or previous versions of the Batman storyline, but does not spend too much time on how Bruce Wayne's path crosses the Joker's tragic story. This version far surpasses any other. The story is fresh, interesting, intelligent and even ventures to be relevant in current times and explains the problems relating to real life mental health issues.
I was engaged and almost sympathetic with the main character as his life takes bad turn after bad turn spiralling into the inevitable climax.
I hope this lays the foundation for future storylines that further develops the character.</div>",Positive
595,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is excellent is dark is crazy is violent Joaquin Phoenix he deserves an oscar director deserve an oscar writers deserve an oscar and one more thing do not go with your kids dont be stupid</div>",Positive
596,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix shows his full range in this performance proving that he is The Joker. Todd Phillips directed this movie with pure passion showing that he cares about his work. The cinematography work by Lawrence Sher is breathtaking, every shot is crisp and clear. The score by Hildur Guonadóttir is haunting and very eerie, giving you an uncomfortable feeling. This movie is nothing but an Oscar worthy film thats deserves every award.</div>",Positive
597,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix has made the Joker character his own and has made a masterpiece out if it. Brilliant movie.</div>",Positive
598,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is so amazing, all act, story... I cant even find right word to describe it. I will tell you that this masterpiece is must watch! Amazing.</div>",Positive
599,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is 100% the film of the year. Looks like Hollywood are still capable of producing masterpieces, I was worried for a second there.</div>",Positive
600,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Literally one of the best films ive seen Joaquin Phoenix deserves atleast a few oscars for this. Mad how it makes you feel sorry for him. The way the film is constantly building suspense throughout is incredible 10/10</div>",Positive
601,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I usually look from the outside in but for this movie I had to register and rate this masterpiece</div>",Positive
602,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I cannot wait for snowflakes to melt away.<br/><br/>It is right up there with the best movies ever. If Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar It will be because of too many snowflake on the panel.</div>",Positive
603,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wished we had joker at jakarta corrupted city at indonesia. Just wishes became truth joker in here so they can learn how to manage the city lolllll</div>",Positive
604,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie was amazing!!
Joaquin Phoenix performance was beautiful</div>",Positive
605,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Thats called realism. Worth watching every second. Bow to Phoenix</div>",Positive
606,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant brilliant brilliant......saw something so good after such a long time..</div>",Positive
607,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best comicbook movie of 2019 hands down. I know people are thinking this movie is overrated. But it's not. I love this movie. Can't wait to see it again :)</div>",Positive
608,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">**** the ""top critics"". This movie is SPECTACULAR!</div>",Positive
609,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am not sure my words can do this justice but here goes.<br/><br/>The acting by phoenix is unbelievable, I have never seen a performance so complete, he is able to convey so much depth throughout his performance. I was drawn into the character to such an extent that I burst out laughing during some violent scenes. The rest of the movie is great, the score, the supporting cast &amp; the storyline were perfect.<br/><br/>This movie will undoubtedly be considered one of the greatest ever made. 10/10</div>",Positive
610,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a lover of thrillers, Joker did not disappoint.
There were times my jaw dropped.. amazing
If you like series like mindhunter this is definetly one to watch!</div>",Positive
611,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well after a long time I've seen such an amazing movie.after watching movie I got goosebumps specially the last scene where he justifies why he changed himself and how disparity leads him to kill people</div>",Positive
612,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">He is the man who always find happiness and peaceful life. We need to watch it at least twice.</div>",Positive
613,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A great film. Phoenix portrays the joker in a mesmerising, Ledger-esque way.</div>",Positive
614,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is the best movie I've seen in my entire life , I'm a DC fan but this movie goes beyond anything I have ever imagined. it touched me in a way that I deeply felt for Arthur fleck ( the protagonist), And Joaquin Phoenix my god how he mastered the art of acting . There's nothing more to be said , do yourself a favor and go watch the movie</div>",Positive
615,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Was well worth the watch! Cracking performance left me just wanting more.</div>",Positive
616,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not a comic anymore..</div>",Positive
617,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Had high hopes for this having seen the trailer. Was better than I could have imagined.. Outstanding performance, I was riveted the whole movie.</div>",Positive
618,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not a comic anymore .</div>",Positive
619,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is a masterpiece with some of the best psychological themes out of any movies. Throughout the movie you feel like Arthur Fleck is being tortured physically and mentally. I don't have much to say just go see it. Let get this movie some oscars.</div>",Positive
620,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm going to keep it simple... this film is brilliant! Believe the hype, it is that good! Sit back and enjoy one very dark, very clever, and very well acted rollercoaster of a movie!!! Simply amazing!!!!</div>",Positive
621,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is in a class of it's own, it cannot be compared to anything else, simple outstanding.</div>",Positive
622,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm speechless. It's a masterclass performance and film. I literally just want to say watch this film! It's one of the best things you'll see.
I am very particular with films and don't give out 10/10s. But this fully deserves it.<br/><br/>Watch it!</div>",Positive
623,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix performance in this movie is beyond mind blowing on top of the movie itself being intresting</div>",Positive
624,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">All the happy ending-, motivational poster-, PC lovers, please, go and watch something else. This movie is not your level of apprehension, so move on.
It's a psychological drama that shows a transformation of a human soul. It raises many problems that many of us just choose to ignore and pretend everything is super-duper.
It's not supposed to be entertaining (is Schindler's list entertaining?!), it's supposed to be disturbing, disgusting, unappealing, but that's the reality a lot of ppl live in. So, open up your eyes and minds and get to know the life as it is without your pink pretty glasses, and be grateful your life is different.</div>",Positive
625,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You have to see it to believe it, I cried a little bit inside my eyes 3 times during the movie, it really moved me out of reality, I had to take 20 minutes at the parking lot to be able to get the movie out of my head and be able to drive home, that serious.</div>",Positive
626,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Better joker than jared leto. Thrilling, nice joker i like it.</div>",Positive
627,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best comic book movie I've seen so far this movie is even darker and realistic than dark knight it will remind you of the dark knight returns by Frank miller. jauquin pheonix nailed the performance he didn't only played the joker he became the joker,the direction is amazing Todd philips did a great job and the soundtrack of the movie is legendary the scores are emotional and scary it give you the feeling that something sinister is about to happen.many critics are complaining that this movie is disturbing and it has violance i don't know what they were expecting from a joker movie.........jokes on them Ha Ha Ha haa</div>",Positive
628,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker has only like 2 or 3 very violent scenes that last only a few seconds, but whose impact is extreme due to how well the character study is developed and written. Simply put, it doesn't glorify violence but magnifies its impact due to its very realistic and personal nature.<br/><br/>Joker (2019) is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Other movies feature the deaths of hundreds and thousands of characters that make you feel zero empathy for them, as the deaths are presented from a purely cinematic and cash-grabbing point of view.<br/><br/>Any movie that doesn't make you feel for the death of its characters was made to grab your cash and your short-lived attention span.</div>",Positive
629,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film was absolutely amazing.Everything is balanced so perfectly.</div>",Positive
630,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The whole movie was very well written and very well connected to batman as well. I am so hyped for the sequel. they have finally done something what they were supposed to do with the joker after the dark knight.</div>",Positive
631,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to life.</div>",Positive
632,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I pretty much never write reviews but as i was left totally speechless by this movie , i feel i have to comment and applaud the brilliance of the actor called Joaquin Phoenix. I honestly forgot during the movie that i was watching an actor and not a really mentally disturbed person. His movements, his expressions , his laughter and the way he talked deeply unnerved me . His eyes were so expressive, especially in the last scene , when you could actually feel what was not said. He deserves all the Oscars in the world for this movie . I believe i have never watched such a haunting performance.
The director did a remarkable job too but you can barely look away from the protagonist to realise how good the film in general is.</div>",Positive
633,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker movie is fantastic right from the start you can feel how arthur feels you go through what he's experiencing and yo actually feel for the guy . I cried almost every scene</div>",Positive
634,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In an industry which is oversaturated with crappy, sterile, rehashed, over reliant on CGI Super hero films, finally a proper film gets made! A film that is not only unique with a gritty yet gripping storyline from start to finish.<br/><br/>It also draws from the traditional methods of a dying art... making special effects secondary and actors pure talent primary! I have just watched a true masterpiece!<br/><br/>It was hard watching, deep moving as-well as being entertaining and thought provoking. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an oscar for this I would be shocked!</div>",Positive
635,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the most impressive movie, and an icon for transforming good feelings to a miserable attitude from an Ignorant society</div>",Positive
636,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Emotionally and everything is great cinematography and lighting and the story I can't explain it</div>",Positive
637,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was looking for a mistake in this movie. But I notice that it is a big mistake to look for a mistake. The act is excellent. One of the best movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>When you decide to rate this movie rate it as a drama movie.</div>",Positive
638,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie which you can not forget. A must watch movie for all the DC fans. Acting, cinematographer, screenplay, direction, BGM everything are so perfect. A must deserving movie for the Oscars.</div>",Positive
639,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">All the funny movies and yet a serious one about a clown!
The movie explains the gore ,dark and the naked truth about the world we all live in. Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix , he truly deserves an oscar for his fantastic portrayal of The Joker.</div>",Positive
640,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Comic book movies are generally something I avoid, but all the hype about his performance intrigued me. I agree with everyone saying he deserves an Oscar for this riveting/painfully intense character study. I had no idea he was so good. The Joker is just a stunning movie.</div>",Positive
641,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">10/10 this movie will have a cult-like following similar to American Psycho. I had know idea Todd Phillips was capable of producing a movie like this. It touched on hard pressing social issues such as isolation, suicide, poverty, mental illness and everything in between. This was movie was set pre social media but I imagine that was touched on as well because social media is destroying us as people but I digress. The movie is going to make the comic book fans of joker go nurs because it's the closest thing to that you will see with the hard R rating some brutal stuff. Somewhere my fellow comic book nerds are all secretly hoping Todd Phillips now directs an Arkham Asylum movie *fingers crossed* this movie is epic do yourself a favor go to the theater and see it.</div>",Positive
642,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have never reviewed a movie before. After watching this movie, I am compelled to reactivate my IMDb account and review this one. Joker is one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. I feel it hasn't been appreciated by many people, even though it is currently rated 9/10 on IMDb. Joaquin was nothing short of extraordinary as an actor. His acting in the movie is chilling. The story and the act perfectly sets up the future joker played by Heath Ledger. It is a dark movie and I understand some people might not enjoy that. But then that doesn't take anything away from the brilliance of this movie.. The movie is exactly what it is supposed to be. Rarely do the movies live up to the hype, and this one did it. It was refreshing to see this unique movie in which superhero doesn't save the world.</div>",Positive
643,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing Chilling Dark Suspeneful Breathtaking Disturbing Terrifying Gloomy</div>",Positive
644,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In love with each and every scene, Life is aweful, so as you Murray, Boom Boom!!</div>",Positive
645,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That is what DC Should do! Please Cut off all the saving-the-world crap. Keep filming dark hero and super villain. Make the story more related to real life and society</div>",Positive
646,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">According to me, Joker is the best movie ever adapted from the comic books. As u all know the movie is about Joker's origin, I dont even want to reveal the plot but I cant keep my mouth shut bcoz it's well written story and well executed. Everything about the movie is excellent, the pace of the story is slow, it's not a cons, it gave enough time to care for the characters around and its also the main reason to feel the elevation of the movie in last 20 mins, the climax was mind blowing. Joaquin Phoenix 🤐🤐🤐 no words can describe his acting, he deserves an oscar for this role. Cinematography is the one big reason for calling this movie a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
647,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everyone should watch this movie, and we should talk about it with young people and in the media. Why? If we put aside the amazing acting, directing and cinematography, it's an enormously important movie for our time. When society overshoots its sustainable capacities, when leaders get so distanced from the people, when we forget about kindness, empathy and mental health... we give birth to those who bring violent change, those who incite anger, fear and exclusivity. Then, all hell breaks loose. Is that the developing direction of our modern civilization?</div>",Positive
648,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Actor Joaquin phoenix should be given oscar award in the villain category for his intensity and specially his laugh.
The movie overall is very good everybody should go watch it.</div>",Positive
649,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">(My English is not perfect because I'm French 😉)<br/><br/>I understand that this film divides because it disturbs and creates deep discomfort from beginning to end. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is breathtaking and deserves an Oscar. Philipps would be entitled to this honor for the staging. The music is ... just ... perfect!<br/><br/>""Joker"": a future cult film, no offense to his detractors. Stanley Kubrick's ""Mechanical Orange"" (1971) has become one.</div>",Positive
650,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loveeed Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"" but my oh my...this guy, Phoenix is so incredible that I'm now rewatching every movie he's ever been in. And don't listen to the magazines, please watch this movie, because they were all talking how Jlo should receive an Oscar for The Hustlers and I listened to them and wasted my money on a cinema ticket for that contentless ""clip on a phone"" All in all, give that man an Oscar</div>",Positive
651,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The many interpretation ways do you see this movie is something incredible.</div>",Positive
652,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Others said it before me. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his rol as the Joker!! Dont need a lot of words to recommend this movie. Just watch!! Its amazing. Very good and emotional storyline. Good camerawork. Good acting. Good music.</div>",Positive
653,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all we should all admit that phoenix is one of the most important actors in the world and most under rated one. see him in joker he lost almost half of his weight dance and do reactions with his face, smile and laugh really hard, he is really legend. the music also was amazing and exciting. but the only objection i have on this movie is the story line and the build of the joker character i think it could be more conflict and suffering but at all it's not a weakness point. the movie is great and will move your feelings hard.</div>",Positive
654,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched a MASTERPIECE, Joker!
Was never fan of Batman nor Joker, but this story, the movie filming and above all, Joaquin Phoenix offer us an outstanding performance to let us experience an incredible moment. Was a long time i wasn't shaken like that.
Thank you Todd, Joaquin and Warner Bros!</div>",Positive
655,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is a classic and I can't get it of my mind! A must watch!</div>",Positive
656,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I knew for sure that this would become one of my favourite movie! Best performance EVER! Phoenix's acting is just so in depth that I could almost overlap my pathetic part of self on him. Definitely have to watch multiple times!!! Quote from anonymous ""While Marvel builds its supervillains with super power, clever brain, money and weapons; DC just gives him a pathetic life"".. All the chaos, insanity, cruelty and indifference is making so much sense now.. It's about how much trauma one would need to become Joker.. It may seem ironic that this guy wants to be a comedian while his whole life is an absolute tragedy, but somehow I feel that the best comedy is always inherently a tragedy. People make fun of something as if in this way they could relieve the pain that they are suffering from. In this sense, I am completely empathetic with his painful and possibly self-mocking laughter condition...Phoenix's performance is just too good and profound, that I almost forgot the cinematography and BGM is just as good as anything else.</div>",Positive
657,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor and he continues to prove that right. I'm not comparing with Heath ledger because his performance was one of the best I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix was a satisfying take on the joker and I couldn't ask for any better.</div>",Positive
658,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie does match the hype and you can ignore the arguments about its one note social commentary. This society doesn't make the Joker but it definitely doesn't help Arthur in not becoming him. The performances are stunning, and this Joker feels insane, not the calculating criminal mastermind of The Dark Knight. Watch it. Stunning, dark, mesmerising and brutal...</div>",Positive
659,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Characters: 9/10

660,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just a masterpiece
an indescribable representation, impressive music and a great melancholy story</div>",Positive
661,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! Great movie, very dark and hard to watch just because if suffer as much as him. Joachim Phoenix's performance is amazing. The story is deep and shows another side of superhero movies.</div>",Positive
662,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply astonishing acting, a wonderful story and showing us all how mental illness isnt something to ignore. Nolans prequel to Dark Knight that he could have only dreamt of.<br/><br/>Give Joaquin all of the awards now. Its in the bag.</div>",Positive
663,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Plot is a little week but i would say that acting of joker is best still the beat joker acting so far.</div>",Positive
664,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I deliberately avoided any trailers so I never knew what to really expect &amp; I'm so glad I did!
Juoquin Pheonix was absolute incredible &amp; really captivated with his performance. The way he told the story of how &amp; why the joker became the joker was actually quite sad. I never wanted this film to end.</div>",Positive
665,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For the first time in my life I left the cinema in complete shock, excitement, terrified and just any feelings you can possibly get from a movie. MASTERPIECE</div>",Positive
666,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film. Hopefully dc continues this dark theme for other films</div>",Positive
667,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I found the bleakness of the plot in this movie a little hard to watch, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a complete masterpiece, as was the cinematography and musical score. I am glad I saw it in the cinema. I just think its a bit of a shame that it derives from a comic book. It could be the new taxi driver.</div>",Positive
668,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A breath of fresh air when it comes to a super hero film. No CGI crap, just a combination of a great script, and surely an oscar winning acting performance from Joaquin Phoenix. I don't think I've seen better character development in a film, which ironically I can only relate to the Joker performance from Heath Ledger some time ago. Despite the unapologetic violence, you somehow feel yourself rooting for the Joker. I read recently that in an interview, Joaquin was asked if he had studied previous Joker performances, to gain a good understanding of what was expected. However, he advised that he did no such thing, and took a completely fresh approach to the character to ensure success. Yes the Joker is meant to be creepy, evil or twisted. But for the first time we see emotion from the Joker - human emotion that as a viewer we can understand and relate to.<br/><br/>I could go on and on.. but to conclude, this is the kind of film that only comes around every 5 years. A true masterpiece.</div>",Positive
669,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">DISREGARD THE GENERATION Y - Z LIBERTARIAN, LEFTIST COMMENTS.
ANYONE birthed within this time period shouldn't be allowed two things, ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON'T PAY TAXES. First, the right to vote for the president of the United States, second, comment on films depicting an era before their daddy squirted them out when every mental condition is diagnosed and treated as common as a bone break needing a cast.<br/><br/>""JOKER"" is the perfect portrayal of how he came to be. Broken down by a disturbing combination of mental anguish and the disgusting behavior of society towards one another created him and his creation is well understood and deserved.
I'm NOT saying his actions are right, but they are understood.</div>",Positive
670,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No words to describe it's hands down EPIC . As usual DC proved its dark ,acting and acting only. Can't take your eyes off from Phoenix. In this fast paced world, we need movies like this sit, relax and enjoy the acting . 2019 is the year people stand by villains like thanos , joker 😃. It's theatre or laptop watch with peace</div>",Positive
671,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw the movie last night and the despair you feel radiating off Arthur during the movie is amazing. The Joker leaves you utterly disturbed but loving it so much and questioning everything you just saw. The physiological roller-coaster you go through in this movie leaves you with so many questions and I can have a conversation for hours about the it. All of this wouldn't be like this if it wasn't for Joaquin Phoenix's stunning portrayal of the Joker the way he plays Arthur's slow decent into madness is absolutely amazing. The Joker has easily become my favorite movie of all time and think it would be a mistake for it not to be nominated for best picture.</div>",Positive
672,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">10/10 doesn't do this movie justice. IMDB needs to make more stars available for the rating of this movie. That's all I'm gonna say.</div>",Positive
673,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't wait to see this movie again!!! When is it coming out to buy???? My brother really enjoyed this movie also!!!</div>",Positive
674,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is about everything. We've been discussing it over and over again with my friends finding new hidden meaning, symbols, idea. Planning to watch it again anytime soon.</div>",Positive

676,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie that makes you really speechless of how amazing it is am so impressed and affected by the performance and creativity what a great job, should get an Oscar definitely or something must be wrong if it didn't ,it has a very deep positive message that teach us to cut out the negative people in our life and that its okay to stop caring about those who wouldn't understand and not welling to listen, thank you so much for being a new legend thank you for the amazing movie.</div>",Positive
677,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An excellent origin story, to an iconic character. Absolutely loved it truly a work of art. The score is amazing as well completely fits the film.</div>",Positive
678,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm ready to start a clown revolution if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. My god, he was good! I just loved this movie. Perfect 10.</div>",Positive
679,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have never written a review in my entire life, but I simply had to point out that you have to see this movie. 10/10
One of the best movies I have ever seen. The depth, the message that this masterpiece delivers goes beyond I have ever imagined. Go watch it. It will make you reflect about a lot.</div>",Positive
680,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just came out of the theater. The Laugh. I can say that Joaquin Phoenix has the best JOKER laugh. You may go crazy. Sometime I thought I would laugh out loud in the theater. The story is fantastic. From start to finish you will be hooked up.<br/><br/>It's a emotional roller costar. Director has nailed it. Awesome cinematography.
It's a no nonsense JOKER movie. NO THE BUILDING WON""T COLLAPSE FROM OUTER SPACE. BUT YOU WILL BURN A CIGARETTE AFTER THE MOVIE IF YOU ARE A SMOKER.</div>",Positive
681,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The cinema was teen crowded, at first I guess they all went to see a new Batman entry and that in the end all of them would be dispointed with the outcome. I was wrong, the kids loved the movie and I was delighted with that.
Todd Philips Joker proves that one can do a thought provoking movie with a proeminent social analysis that can have effect on kids and grown ups.
Joker is a beautiful, raw and wonderfully played by Joachin Phoenix, best joker ever.
Rotten society can and would create monsters out of its outskirts ostracized people, this isn´t just a movie, this is real life, in your face.
Bravo!!
10 STARS</div>",Positive
682,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Forget about Marvel's summer blockbusters: Joker is not a superhero (or supervillain) flick.
It is a love letter to 1970s' and Martin Scorcese's cinema, and more especially The King of Comedy (1982), whose script Joker draws heavily upon. I strongly advise viewers to watch the two films one after the other to appreciate the influence Scorcese had on Phillips. You just have to consider these two films as twins, Joker being the deformed, nevrotic sibling of The King of Comedy.
Phillips' movie also presents an economic and social panorama of the end of 1970s America - although some might say this comment may still be true nowadays.
Phoenix is incredible: his performance is a real tour de force, an Oscar-winning one.
Of course, one could point out one or two flaws in the film, but overall Joker is the masterpiece everyone was waiting for.</div>",Positive
683,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix absolutely owns this movie. i don't know what to say about this movie that hasn't been said yet, but go see it immediately.</div>",Positive
684,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, just wow, incredible!! Never been a massive fan of Phoenix but what a performance, just give him the Oscar now because nobody will get anywhere near him!</div>",Positive
685,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely, it deserves above 9 stars.
I gave it 10, for incredible acting, direction and story.
And I would prefer not to compare with the dark knight, both joker are in different situations and different story and both are great in there respective places.</div>",Positive
686,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For me personaly it is the best Movie of the Year! You will Laug, Screaming, Crying, Dancing! The Joker is a awesome Person!</div>",Positive
687,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Awesome standalone movie. I really didn't even think it needed to be a Batman movie nor does it at all fit into that universe. No way is this joker the Mastermind behind a criminal gang. Almost more like fan fiction. For what it is though it is very well made.</div>",Positive
688,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The spectacle of joaquin phoenix acting to be the greatest villain in DC is outstanding and at the same time questions the morality of audience.</div>",Positive
689,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is dark , gritty and masterful Joaquain is seriously amazing as he perfects the joker and all supporting cast are great and build up an amazing film</div>",Positive
690,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin's acting was superb, after watching I was pretty much speechless. Do yourself a favor and go watch it you'll love it.</div>",Positive
691,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a movie whit a good plot, I think that they violence it's necesary for we understanded our society.</div>",Positive
692,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If this Joaquin, or this movie, does not win an Oscar (minimum of 1) I'm suing the Academy</div>",Positive
693,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix's performance is amazing and never boring</div>",Positive
694,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie best describes the character of joker and how he became the joker.... It is absolutely thrilling and acting is legendary by Phoenix.
You dont wanna miss watching this movie in Theater that has the best quality screen, like IMAX or UAVX.
Have fun watching it.</div>",Positive
695,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I personally think this movie gave me everything I could ever dream of in a origin joker film. He may not be a criminal master mind in it, but still is an evolving killer. Somehow the setup of events made me sympathize for his character and his interpretation gave me chills. If you have not been to the movie theater in a long time, this is the movie to go to.</div>",Positive
696,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It a master piece :so dark and so sad but it sooo good this is the perfect movie that should everyone see it show you what can the society do with person and turn him into another one.</div>",Positive
697,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Story is great. Loved the movie 10/10</div>",Positive
698,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is one of THE best comic book adaptations ever, for me it's right up there with the Dark Knight trilogy. Ignore critics! Ever since wonder woman received glowing crItic reviews I knew the they shouldn't be relied on to give an unbiased, un-politicised a review of a movie. I believe the critics saw the news headlines and were scared to give and actual honest review. Anyways enjoy!</div>",Positive
699,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I never thought they could pull off a Villain solo film without it being apart of some giant cinematic universe(like Universals recents The Mummy reboot.) . But when I saw the trailer, it got me intrigued by the direction they are taking the character and what kind of film this gonna be. From the Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, the well done cinematography, perfect music, the writing and so much more! But this film is a incredibly dark, do not take your children to this. This film talks themes of mental illness, insanity, murder, and suicide.</div>",Positive
700,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved the movie. Great actor. Great story. Great film</div>",Positive
701,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok, first of all, I'm not spoiling this movie. Joker is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is a good joker. I'd say Heath Ledger and him are even. Definitely not a kids movie.</div>",Positive
702,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">THIS FILM IS NOT A FAMILY FILM! It is the birth of a character and not portrayal. It is a character study of a evolution of a man's descent into the criminally insane. A full on exploration of why Joker's brand of villainy and why it is essential to the birth of the Dark Knight. If Phoenix wins the Oscar, history will be made, portrayal of the same character (2 times) wins.<br/><br/>Phoenix, Phillips, and the Movie Oscar worth? We shall see.</div>",Positive
703,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all this is the begining of the joker's story, the Batman doesnt even exist in this movie, Bruce Wayne is a little kid, i think that a little kid wouldnt defeat joker so, if this is a begining, it means that joker has a lot to grow as a villain right? Lets not be dumb here and say this joker is not smart because you didnt see him in action, this is the story of how Arthur Fleck becomes the joker, not the story of how the joker destroys Gotham city
The movie is great, has a great story and it has a big impact on people who have the mind and the eyes to see this movie
Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar and it is legitim to say that this is a masterpiece, because it is
Stop criticising just because you feel like top critics, you're not, you wanna be original, watch the movie with an open mind, because you need a good mind to see this movie
And stop with the ""Im giving 6 because of all the 10"", Im giving 10 because it is a 10/10</div>",Positive
704,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Two guaranteed Oscar wins for Joaquin and the movie itself , well hopefully..</div>",Positive
705,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Must watch, one of the beat films I've ever seen. The way his character changes though out the film is brilliant.</div>",Positive
706,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Long, looong over due masterpiece that has all the markinga of being made frome the clasic era.. No words can explain this work of art so it's an absolute must see and in full theater experience mode.. Don't miss this one.. ""Joker"" 2019 will stand the test of time and thus take it's rightful place among the all-time, very best cinematic pieces.. The themes/messages are those most pressing and brewing now and for some time directly from our contemporary reality itself while the few political referrence trace to eons old subject matter that will always wear well and, finally, a charcter analysis that dive's as deep into that topic that most films shy from fully scrutinizing.. I'm the stingiest with my ratings but sometime a far and few in between appear's that command's everyones respect.. My full 10 star in I can't recall how long</div>",Positive
707,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Overall amazing movie! Even though it strives far from the OG concept, it touches on realism and how the real world functions as well as its killers. Overall amazing acting, amazing plotting, amazing deaths and great touch on realism. Love it! Go watch it, even if its bloody.</div>",Positive
708,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the in the top ten of the best movies I ever watched. Joaquin Phoenix did a perfect job doing the joker. It was awesome to be able to see how the joker got his mannerisms and how everything came into play even though I expected it, it was still jaw dropping. This movie is a must watch.</div>",Positive
709,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Para mi, la mejor representación en película de la transformación de un villano de los cómics.</div>",Positive
710,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing but a masterpiece from J.Pheonix and T.Phillips 👏🏾</div>",Positive
711,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay, I am not usually a drama person but I love joker from Batman. We all do. That's why I wanted to give this movie a shot knowing it's only drama. And I am really glad I took that decision. Every single act of Jaoqlin was incredible. He really put life to the character Joker. When I was watching the movie, I felt like I was living through him as a joker. Hands-down the best acting ever. The movie is nothing like you expect from the regular drama. Trust me, I thought it would be inspirational but...not really and I actually liked that. The movie is about how he came to be what he is and you actually tend to understand him more and more and you will love joker now. I could keep writing but I don't want to give any spoilers. This movie is a must watch for any kind of movie lovers.</div>",Positive
712,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is about what happens in the world about people's behavior towards each other and all we care about is money and glory</div>",Positive
713,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A dark reflection of a man's descent into the nightmare world of mental illness and it's repercussions on a society that offers him no empathy, understanding or contrition. Arthur is a desperately sad individual who is the victim of his own utterly dysfunctional upbringing, a mental condition that causes him to laugh inappropriately and his complete inability to engage with his colleagues or interact with society. Phoenix is phenomenal, an actor who must have studied and understood the illness he expertly portrays and the catastrophic results if it is left untreated.
Arthur is a clown and a failed comedian who, due to the collapse of social care has his treatment funding and his medication withdrawn. He's his mother's carer and obsessed with De Niro's TV character. That's all you need to know.
The violence is extreme, bloody but totally in context with the character and plot, however many will find one particular scene extremely disturbing. You've been warned.
A brilliant film, disturbing, harrowing and thoroughly gripping. Washington Post scored it 2/4 - ignore it and make up your own mind.</div>",Positive
714,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At last there's an adult film about The Joker &amp; hopefully the shape of things to come from the DC &amp; Marvel worlds. Fingers crossed Batman follows suit. Makes all the other comic book films look like Sesame Street.</div>",Positive
715,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">He movie was great and the acter do very well and i love it and i hop he get the oscar</div>",Positive
716,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film, addressing real problems within societies. Social unfairness, cruelty to each other , carelessness</div>",Positive
717,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films of the decade. Joaquin Phoenix is simply amazing. No competitor for this year's oscar.</div>",Positive
718,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So good iv Seen it twice. Best acting ever. Totally Oscar-worthy</div>",Positive
719,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix was incredible and deserves a best actor award for his performance. This is a very dark and confronting movie with amazing acting, great cinematography and a good soundtrack. The story really sticks with you. I was so surprised by this ""superhero"" movie. It's like no other. Even Robert De Niro's casting in his role is genius after his recent public interview carry ons just like the character he plays in this movie. A must see!</div>",Positive
720,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We can understand why vilains are vilains. They show us the bad side of the good people</div>",Positive
721,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No over the top cgi, no relying on green screens, just a raw, dark and amazing performance. Thank God it was rated R, a must see movie.</div>",Positive
722,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix's performance was amazing, and haunting. The cinematography was beautifully made. The whole cast did a great job. I was not disappointed. A great perspective of the Joker and the mental illness that shaped him. Great movie, great joker, wonderful performance! Hats off to you, Joaquin.</div>",Positive
723,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you were expecting this to be an action movie or a superhero movie... well you are wrong.... this movie is all about Joaquin Phoenix becoming the Joker, the making of the Joker., some scenes are so wonderfully shot..all you gotta do is sit back and enjoy. This actor though, so much talent there! Wow absoltely loved it! I understand some will be disappointed, to be honest I wasnt expecting this for a Joker Movie but in the end it was truly worth it!</div>",Positive
724,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Excellent movie very well defines how Joker exists in Gotham city and the conditions how turned him to be Joker</div>",Positive
725,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing actions, Joker delicately treads a fine line between what need to be explicitly told and what audiences must interpret themselves. It's not an exaggeration to say this has best character development I've seen in a movie. Would undoubly recommend it to anyone. It's a contender for the movie of the decade, if there's such thing.</div>",Positive
726,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The events flowed naturally and it was an overall good movie to watch. Very nice acting as well.</div>",Positive
727,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I kept a lot of patience before finally deciding to watch the movie after 3 weeks. Since there was so much hype about the movie i waited for my friends feedback who were head and heels over the acting of Joaquin. I regret being a fool and waiting for the reviews rather than using my instincts. Boy was i wrong. This movie is so beautifully crafted. It's perfectly dark and though the storyline is slow, it was justified since It had to show Jokers development as a character. Joaquin certainly deserves an oscar for his acting. What a legendary performance! Dont miss this one pls!</div>",Positive
728,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really love this movie, what a acting this man doing in this movie.... Legend</div>",Positive
729,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you don't see this movie, go to cinema raith now.</div>",Positive
730,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The world of Hollywood seems to just churn out cliche'd, shallow, unoriginal garbage with an overdose of special effects.<br/><br/>is so refreshing to find a film that takes the time to build a storey, character and not loose it's way to the very end. well done to all involved for creating an engaging, well acted, directed and edited film.<br/><br/>I hope the success of this film is a lesson to the film makers that a good storyline and acting, and not following the crowd is the way forward.</div>",Positive
731,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I watched the Joker movie at my local cinema, I prepared myself for the unexpected. After scene after scene, when the movie finished and went home. BOI I FELT SO ALIVE! The adrenaline feeling I got from the movie was no adrenaline feeling from a movie I've ever gotten! The movie was exciting, shocking, mind-twisting and 100% FANTASTIC! Joaquin Phoenix DESTROYED the roll man, he's a great Joker actor. The last time we have gotten a good Joker actor was Heath Ledger from 2012 The Dark Knight. I can see how the ghost of Heath in the Joker costume is proudly saying to Phoenix behind him: ""You did amazing. Got get em, brother."" Get it since they both played the Joker? Anyways, a must-watch experience!</div>",Positive
732,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix is impeccable and a credit to his craft. By hook or by crook you have to see this version of Joker, I found myself rooting for the guy and then .......</div>",Positive
733,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing film, great story.
Juakine Phoenix should have Oscar for this role.
Couldn't take my eye from the screen</div>",Positive
734,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Went to see this last night with my girlfriend  VIP Cineplex and absolutely amazing, brilliant, the best!! And i knew before even seeing it that Heath would be shining down on Arthur and smiling. What a wonderful, creative and artistic movie, and something everyone can relate too... I want to see it again and again it was that good and my heart was pounding near the end of the movie.. Bravo and let the awards pour in! Cheers all!</div>",Positive
735,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just brilliant. It's a got to see at the cinema film.</div>",Positive
736,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix is absolutely outstanding what a performance!!!</div>",Positive
737,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In my opinion, the movie is about the people of the world that doesn't give a dime about the people tin suffering. An ignorant world, full of ignorant people. It is also about a man that struggles whit his mental issues, somehow being able to realize his condition. He begs the world for help, he wanted to be a normal man, but the world is deaf.
And when the world give up on us, the same world is terrified about what could happen!
I was totally shut down by this movie. As majority of the reviewers said, it is, by far, the best movie in years..
From time to time, the movie industry talk real life problems.
Mr. Phoenix representation put me in such emotional conditions that I was able to wake up to reality many hours after the movie ends.
From my point of view, is way up ro Malek that won last year. There is no comparison. I can't remember somebody playing like this in years!
Go see in in theater, because no TV and sound system can reproduce the atmosphere from the cinema.</div>",Positive
738,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">He has right at the end of the movie.
We are treated like puppies!</div>",Positive
739,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Do you know batman? The light of justice that work in the darkest night...
OK, from now batman it will be a second character. Jaquine Phoenix is simply amazing, creates emotions from the beginning to the end and became Joker in a symbol. I love this film.</div>",Positive
740,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So strong, outstanding acting, strong message.
i never saw anyone so tallent, that gave the mental illness another interpretation.
it really made me feel so empathy to this subject.
it really made me cry, cause i'm struggling with it myself. all of my life just trying to fit in, just like the Joker.<br/><br/>well done!!</div>",Positive
741,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.</div>",Positive

745,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best Movie
Masterpiece
What a acting by Joaquin Phoenix</div>",Positive
746,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a fan of Joaquin I was looking forward to this movie after the trailer and you know what I wasn't disappointed and it emphasizes why the joker is the best villain character ever. Great character development, beautiful cinematography and truly phenomenal acting by Joaquin Phoenix, I must say he really went deep into the character and stole our hearts on this one !!!
A great movie and story!</div>",Positive
747,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like Robert Mitchum in ""Night of the hunter"", ""Joker"" is for you. Like Mitch, Joaquim Phoenix is a deranged character with no real purpose in life, just auto destructing. The omnipresent Joaquim Phoenix is really frightening with his skeleton silhouette, he is a tragic loser because of stupid people humiliating his weakness, he becomes sick and gets revenge, and finally his madness becomes infectious. He reminds me of the pathetic punk singer in Todd's Phillips first movie, the documentary ""Hated"". ""Joker"" is definitely not a movie for children.<br/><br/>
In one of the chaotic last sequence, you can hear ""White room"" by cult group Cream, whose fabulous drummer died one month ago.</div>",Positive
748,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I haven't enjoyed a movie these last years that much than Joker. It's indeed masterpiece of 21st century.</div>",Positive
749,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.</div>",Positive
750,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movies is nothing short of a masterpiece. Fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Must see movie!</div>",Positive
751,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So well made. Acting, Soundtrack, everything is amazing. This is the real deal.</div>",Positive
752,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was big fan of batman series. But this movie has changed all. First time in life I have seen bad character with so much of focus on it.<br/><br/>Again.. He made it. I think he(JP) is new Joker.</div>",Positive
753,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the heath ledger gave a mind blowing performance it is hard to see some actors playing that role but Pheonix gave his best however it nowhere near heath performance but it was a great experience the message was also conveyed that people treat some people so badly if anyone will lose his/her what can happen</div>",Positive
754,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I read the miserable reviews from the critics and nearly didn't go and see this. What a load of crap their reviews are - this film is absolutely out of this world. Your mind doesn't drift at any point and you remain completely focused to a dazzling performance.</div>",Positive
755,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is a masterpiece, everything is top notch from the acting to the cinematography. there is a reason its doing as well as it is the film is phenomenal.
how did that boycott work out?</div>",Positive
756,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I cannot think how the movie could have been done better. Perfect lead role, writing and cinematography. The movie makes you feel differently about the lead character's struggle and the only way to cope with your questionable feelings is to talk about it with others who have seen the movie. The standard to be a rememberable Joker is a very challenging role to achieve and only very few actors can accomplish this; Joaquin Phoenix is one of those actors.</div>",Positive
757,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really, really hope that hero movie producers get inspired by the film, so they start creating drama masterpieces like this. I'm done with goofy plots and characters! This movie has already become a legend! A must watch for everyone--fan or not of the hero genre. This is the best movie of the year, and both Todd Phllips and Joaquim Phoenix deserve the Oscar. Nuff said.</div>",Positive
758,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie does not make the critical mistake of trying to remake heath ledger's performance. Instead, Phoenix takes his own spin on the role making it into something just as Oscar worthy as Ledger's. Additionally this movie does not glorify violence but shows the horrific reality of mental illness and Trump's America. This was a statement that needed to be made</div>",Positive
759,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite everything nice, the story did not forget the first film, it is nice to go back to the first impressions again</div>",Positive
760,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you haven't seen it yet and fancy something different, joker is definitely worth a watch Joaquin Phoenix is just utterly brilliant!! 10/10 I've seen it twice already, in 2 days and I could go and see it again!!</div>",Positive
761,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I never take anyone's rating for granted in two things, food &amp; movies obviously. I have my own system of rating which is getting goosebumps during a movie, and boy did this movie ranked high in my system. I even tested the movie for a second and he still maintained that perfect goosebumps ranking.
This movie is simply ranked in the top 10 of my all time movies list, but then again as I started what taste so amazing in my ranking may not be even edible by others</div>",Positive
762,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not disappointed, brilliant acting, hope the is a sequel of it. !!</div>",Positive
763,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perhaps there are better films. Perhaps its a mishmash of other films. But at the end of the day I was terrified, I laughed, I was on the edge of my seat, and Joaquin Phoenix truly did a fantastic job as the Joker. His performance alone is worth the price of admission.</div>",Positive
764,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Love it. Makes you think about mentally illness both what's it like to haveand howw have you treated people with them in the past and how will you in the future. I loved the score and camera work. Never has movie been this powerful tackling mental illness since one flew over the coo coos nest. The media reaction supports the movie concept which is genius. Love the violence because it's real and so are the characters. The conclusion us nothing short of majestic. One of my all time favorite movies and would be 10 if it didnt pull so much from taxi driver.</div>",Positive
765,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Please give Joaquin at least one Oscar!
Movie is a masterpiece, can't wait to watch it a third time in cinema.</div>",Positive
766,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best acting on the white screen I've ever seen. Joaquin IS the joker. The acting, the direction, the score, the cinematography come together perfectly in this masterpiece. It's impossible to imagine another actor taking on the role as the joker after this. I can honestly say that I had huge expectations before going to the cinema but somehow this movie was better than I expected. It left me speechless and I went home wanting to know more. As a result of this I ended up reading ""Batman, the killing joke"" which I wouldn't have done otherwise. Arthur Fleck reminds me of Travis Bickle (Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver) and Alex (Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange). So if you appreciate the art of movie making then this movie is for you.</div>",Positive
767,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If someone leaves with bully, this movie will inspired him</div>",Positive
768,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a lot more artfully and skillfully done than I had anticipated for a Joker origin story, and I was incredibly satisfied. Not pretentious, edgy, or cliche like it could have easily turned out. The pace was perfect. The psychological undertones didn't feel forced and weren't insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Joaquin's performance was just as captivating, raw, and uncomfortable as it needed to be for the tone, and the social commentary on mental illness, public perception, and even aspects of society were concerningly relatable.<br/><br/>For as much as I enjoyed it, 10/10. Exceeded expectations and pleased my brain. I'll watch it again.</div>",Positive
769,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie caught me from the first second. So disturbing and amazing at the same time. A true masterpiece that let you feel every aspect of the character.</div>",Positive
770,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">DOPE MOVIE! I love it! Its so realistic and so dark. DC IS BACK!</div>",Positive
771,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin's performance is Amazing, It's really great!!</div>",Positive
772,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There was some points of view of the life of a man just want to make laugh and be happy but the world doesn't want it and everyone around of this man doesn't understand :<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck: It's funny, when I was a little boy, and told people I was going to be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. Well, no one's laughing now.<br/><br/>is this a real life person outside of gotham or a fictional fantasy character in the screens ?<br/><br/>i dont know i dont have the answer/
i'm laughing now and i'm laughing and lau....</div>",Positive
773,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Did I just watched the movie of a decade? I can't believe. It's just so...so good. There will come a time, when people will write thesis on this movie. It's a study. It's an art. It's just...best as it can get.
Amazing performances. Joaquin Phoenix breathes a new life into the character. Comic movies can be better than mainstream cinemas...this flick is the proof.
Watch it, before you die.
Comic Lovers...Time to put on a Happy Face!!! 🤡</div>",Positive
774,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is truly Oscar worthy. And Joaquin Phoenix is sexy and powerful and his depth sees no end. He truly succeeded in taking the role of a well known superhero villain and brought him to life making him human, relatable and someone you want to support. Every minute of this film was perfectly acted and perfectly detailed. The creators of this film truly understand the human condition and what makes a great film.</div>",Positive
775,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a very psychological film and I have not seen a film of this caliber in a while. Anybody giving this film bad ratings or bad reviews just doesn't get it. This better win a ton of awards.</div>",Positive
776,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing movie. See this movie with total attention, nobody must disturb you, and just enjoy.</div>",Positive
777,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is a dark, satirical look at one of the most infamous characters in history. With fantastic performances, fascinating themes, an incredible score and gorgeous cinematography helps make 'Joker' a poignant masterpiece and a huge milestone for comic book adaptations.</div>",Positive
778,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Phoenix gives an Oscar winning performance of a 1 off take what makes a man descend into madness and become the clown prince of crime. Film just blew me away</div>",Positive
779,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliantly acted by Joaquin Phoenix. Great speed and timing. Great cinematography. The low ratings sayings it's dark.... ummm that's what it's basically about. People that say He is not smart enough to be the joker, the joke is on you. Please watch and make your own decisions. It was a film that left me with flash backs to great moments for days afterwards.</div>",Positive
780,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was skeptical with this movie when it first came out, even more when people started liking it. But now that I've seen it, it just blew me away. A sigh of fresh breath of an awesome movie. At first I thought it's gonna be slow gloomy and boring but man was I wrong! It may seem that way, but I enjoyed every bit of it. Everyone can relate to the main character. And Joaquin Phoenix's performance is superb hands down! I didn't mind the progress of the movie, for me everything is awesome. I just wanted to see more of it, I gotta see more! I would kill off batman without hesitation if this is the Joker. Oh man! I can't wait for a sequel, I wish they'd make one. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out on something super awesome!</div>",Positive
781,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A truly INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE from an AMAZING MOVIE STAR/ACTOR.</div>",Positive
782,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best film ever i have watched and probably the best film ever by Joaquin Phoenix. Literally, awesome. An Oscar Winner! 👏👏👏</div>",Positive
783,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The second best Joker movie so far. I have only one problem with this movie Willem Dafoe is not Joker. People who made the rating drop from 9/10 need help.</div>",Positive
784,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's silent craziness at his perfection. what an awesome performance by Phoenix... i was thrilled or enjoyed the weirdness during the whole movie. that's definitely one of the best (and proper) prequel i have seen so far.</div>",Positive
785,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, after watching it all I have are positive thoughts about it.I clearly understand why some people are criticising it. Because of It's revolution against capitalism. Despite that, it was a movie about a man who gets Bullied by the society and becomes the joker. Hervy dent said in the dark knight ""you either die a hero or live long to see yourself the villain."" It was though to play joker since heath ledger took the character into legendary level. But Joaquin phoniex does true Justice to the character. It was a masterclass performance by him. Finally, I hope he'll get his oscar. Great direction, cinematography, dialogues you'll get in the movie. But it's not a movie that the general mass eat. Everyone has different choices. So, if you a movie lover, don't miss it.!</div>",Positive
786,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Introducing Joker in this movie is very interesting. Joaquin Phoenix is one of pro memorable artists. I don't compare him with other Jokers because of different movie story and conditions but his acting in this movie with this story is a masterpiece!
More than every thing I love his laughs and dances :)
At the end of movie, I expect at least some extra minutes for story completeing and more violence. This is why I expect Joker 2.
And also we know why some people was nervous about expanding violence in society but we don't live in Gotham city! Or we? :)</div>",Positive
787,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix
Very talented
Strong act
Very well done</div>",Positive
788,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best of 2019, in my opinion. Waiting for the second one.</div>",Positive
789,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was cry , it's the first movie that made me cry.
Joaquin had awesome and unique performance in joker and his other movies.
he is the one and only acter in the world who deserve oscar.
i wish someday see and grab him in my arms to death</div>",Positive
790,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the most mesmerizing movies I've ever seen. Phoenix delivered an INSANELY amazing performance, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen for even one second. Such brilliant acting. GIVE THAT MAN ALL THE AWARDS!</div>",Positive
791,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie divides me the most, it's not just a superhero movie in fact it's stronger points are the the performance from Phoenix and the social message it delivers. Just imagine how closer people like that live around us...
Nonetheless it's a piece of cinema history, not an enjoyable movie, a great movie.</div>",Positive
792,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watching many movies on joker but he didn't get his life on screen. Todd Phillip succeed to bring this out. He succeed to develope of his character and draw the great scatch of his life. Movie was not about the gunshots, not about the killing Batman and he's not his enemy too. Joker was far from all this. The moment showed in the movie was the beginning of revenge from the Wayne family.</div>",Positive
793,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is brought to the big screen in a way that you'll have no choice not to empathize him that It may be triggering to some people with problem glasses.<br/><br/>""The bad man who's bad because he's bad"" turns out to be marginalized and treated poorly in society. We slowly witness him become who he is and how he actually stops being a victim as soon as he spills blood. Hard to watch at times, very dark and bleak but most importantly unforgettable. It's worth watching just for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. It is something else.</div>",Positive
794,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This should serve as a a primary example of a cinema masterpiece from here on to whoever wants to make or watch a film. Never in my life has my heart beat that fast to a film and never have I visibly shook or cringed or laughed after a murder. Joaquin does a fantastic job of getting in your head and the soundtrack is godly. The ending to the film will leave you wondering what is planet you're on. This film doesn't deserve the hate just because it ""promotes/glorifies violence"" or because it was made by the white man. Miles ahead of literally any other film I've watched, and i would say i have quite a picky and adventurous taste. Phenomenal</div>",Positive
795,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joker is the action movie and is so good because is one of my favorite movie for example a very good song effects and also a very good authors.<br/><br/>The movie consists of a person who goes crazy by means of people bullying him and on the other hand by his mental problem that makes him act badly. On the other hand, through the illness he has and through the people who bother him, he takes different actions as if it were to get back at those people who killed him until he becomes a serial killer.<br/><br/>The action in this movie affected me mainly because it shows realistic images that satisfy me,for example the sound effects of blood shots are very realistic and satisfying.<br/><br/>I liked the movie a lot because it stars one of my favorite actors, mainly because I like how he acts and I like the clothes he wears, but the best thing is the reactions that he has in the moments of revenge.</div>",Positive
796,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At first, I was skeptical to watch this movie because well its ""joker"" - i kinda predict what its all about. But the actor was just wow! I couldn't recognize him in the movie set. Best acting performance ever! Well done!</div>",Positive
797,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How life would be if joker is a real person. This movie tells you.</div>",Positive
798,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a touching epos! Joaquin Phoenix in the role of his life, maybe. He carries the entire film In every single second.</div>",Positive
799,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let us not forget this is the origin story of a psychotic maniac.<br/><br/>We sympathize with him because we feel the injustice, but do we agree with him?<br/><br/>People break all the time, the system breaks people, it was created by monarchs and neo-colonialists... no wonder we are all confused.<br/><br/>What is broken can be fixed, but with the right choices.<br/><br/>This is a great movie 10/10, the only problem I have, are the values and principles that it teaches. But as with anything in life, it's a double edge sword.</div>",Positive
800,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I normally don't get invested into dark crime movies but this is nothing like I expected it to be it had me at the edge of my seat amazing performance from Joaquin phoenix he was amazing the creepy moments the funny moments and the very sinster moments he made the character his own and but they did overuse Robert de niro amazing film hope to see a sequel maybe.</div>",Positive
801,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow just wow. Absolutely phenomenal, I have always been a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix since I was a child. Watching him evolve over the years has been extraordinary. He's intellectually artistic and creatively artistic. He brings this movie to life. Not to mention I'm a huge fan of the comic book character Joker and man he went above a beyond. Haven't seen a joker like him since Heath Ledger, another legend obviously. Finally the Joker gets to tell his story.</div>",Positive
802,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a nice movie..the acting was amazing by the joker...the story is also very good...the smile and the dialogue of the jocker was ironic....big treat for DC watchers...go and watch it</div>",Positive
803,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How this movie has 68% on Rotten Tomatoes!!!!! 😡😡</div>",Positive
804,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A masterpiece, it is one of those gems whose name will always be taken whenever there will be a discussion about the great cinema of the world. No doubt that Joker is loved more than the Super rich so called Hero or I should say ""the good one"".
Joker never wanted to be what he became, all he ever wanted was some love and respect but the irony is, that he never got it, not when he was a normal guy, not when he became the cold blooded criminal.
Some people are saying there was not enough reason for him to be doing this, but you can never imagine the mental pain of other people.
Now about the movie, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is unbelievable and the story is awesome.<br/><br/>WHY SO SERIOUS????
PUT ON A HAPPY FACE AND WATCH THE MOVIE.</div>",Positive
805,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just incredible, this movie makes you want to instantly watch it again.</div>",Positive
806,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films of the decade, a unique film, a masterpiece, one of the best films of all time, the film industry needs more film like this ...</div>",Positive
807,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just one of those movies everyone should see and will watch back in some years</div>",Positive
808,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I first watched this I felt like I was about to throw up, I can't even fully describe how I felt. A movie had never effected me like that before. I recommend this movie to anyone.</div>",Positive
809,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You never get to see such type of movies nowadays right??..i mean like for example Heath ledger from Dark Knight.. who has such kind of power to potray the art??..well he got some competition..here Joaquin showed what he really he is capable of, what an incredible acting, immensely adamant character he did in this project was absolutely genius..well he do deserve the Oscar</div>",Positive
810,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Marvelous and exhilarating experience. Puts the viewers on edge yet sympathizing for a commonly misunderstood character. The sickly lighting and colour scheme was visually pleasing and fit perfectly to the mood of the story told of Arthur Flecks rise. The soundtrack was dark and hypnotizing yet beautiful and melodic and really immersed the viewer into the film. Acting was genuine and came off as if the actors were really the characters in real life. A definite must see if you're up for a thought provoking film.</div>",Positive
811,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film about joker life's is one of the best DC Movies.
Is powerful and exciting I recommend this film to you if you love DC.
Real masterpiece.</div>",Positive
812,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Look I am seen in my life many types of movie this is one of my favourite movie because that the acting was class apart and unique storyline and this film is related with us..Joaquin Rafael Phoenix acting very well in this movie choreography of this film is a masterpiece</div>",Positive
813,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic throughout the film and I have to congratulate Todd Phillips and all the cast for this amazing movie.I am waiting for the Joker 2!!!</div>",Positive
814,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I need more films like this one in the comic book world, since i watched this movie, i cannot stop thinking about it, that´s how good it was, this movie had a real strong social impact in many countries, Joaquin Phoenix deserved that Oscar his performance was a masterpiece</div>",Positive
815,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fantastic movie, lots of impressions. Highly recommend to watch.</div>",Positive
816,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies of the decade. Great cast along with good story.</div>",Positive
817,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego:</div>",Positive
818,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think the Joker we know as the antagonist to Batman is actually the guy in the alley who kills the Wayne's. I think he was inspired by Arthur Fleck but Arthur is not our Joker. He would be way to old by the time this Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.</div>",Positive
819,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! An amazing realistic story with a masterclass performance by Joaquin Phoenix.</div>",Positive
820,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was so good that me and Meltem forgot that Stefan was with us.</div>",Positive
821,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am not a comic book movie fan with the exception of some of the Batman films. Joker is certainly either the best or one of the very best of the Batman franchise. It is dark, painful, grimy, harsh and sometimes almost impossible to watch due to the suffering and pain of the central character. Joaquin Phoenix just torches the screen with an undeniably great performance. Is the film a masterpiece ? Not sure. Is his performance a masterwork of the art of film acting ? I think so. You cannot take your eyes off Phoenix and especially his kinetic serpentine performance. Never have I seen a film role with such intense physicality. Turn off the sound and the film would likely make complete sense, so visual is the main character at conveying meaning and emotion. The Oscar went to the right guy this time for certain. I think Phoenix really sits at the apex of great film actors working today. He reminds me of Brando in terms of sheer intensity and focus. A really excellent film and a stunning performance by the lead character.</div>",Positive
822,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movies character study was probably the most brilliant thing I've ever witnessed. It would honestly be a giant disservice to mankind if Joaquin didnt do another movie for obvious reasons if you've seen Joker already. Arthur fleck, man. Gotta feel for the man. But I need a sequel to see JOKER in all his glory and rage, leaving arthur fleck behind. And the apartment scene at the end during Arthur's.......""transformation"" is the most insent, chilling, heart pounding 10 minutes of film I've seen since saving private ryan in the 90s. So intense and amazing. 10!</div>",Positive
823,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best, maybe even the best, movies I have seen in the last and in this year so far. A misunderstood movie if you read the reviews on the news. Is it brutal? Yes. Is it shocking? Yes. Does it cheer people up to become violent? No. This movie asks the audience to look behind the obvious. It asks us to reflect ourselves, as the person we are on our own and the society we builded up. As an empath I was deeply touched and hurt by the suffering of Arthur Fleck, the main character. His development is relatable and performed brilliantly by a Joaquin Phoenix in best form. JP is transforming in both characters, Arthur and then becoming more and more the Joker, so very commiting that it will take your breath. The score underlines perfectly the feelings of the main character and if you open up, this movie will get under your skin. It is an emotional ride with social criticism at it's realest.</div>",Positive
824,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched this movie and all I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW!!! It's not everyday that a movie can captivate me to the point where I can't keep my eyes off the screen... This was incredibly;e everything!! This was the most incredible;e performance I have ever seen. Truly amazing!! Really Enjoyed it. Congratulations to everyone involved in this production.</div>",Positive
825,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was thrilling and fun. I am really looking forward to second part.</div>",Positive
826,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just saw the movie and got mesmerized. Great job team.. am expecting the sequel soon.</div>",Positive
827,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One the few movies I've seen recently that's a true return to great film making. Joaquin's performance is fantastic and stirred all sorts of reactions in me, from awkwardness, in response to Arthur's inappropriate laughing condition, to pity, in response to his spiral into dispair, to marvel, in response to his meteoric rise to infamy. The accompanying soundtrack complements and completes the film perfectly. A truly great origin story that is a credit to DC.</div>",Positive
828,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've watched this movie 3 times in the cinema and just a few days ago again on Blue-ray and I'm still impressed how good this movie is. Probably one of my all time favorites. The story is so good and Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect choice for the role of the Joker.</div>",Positive
