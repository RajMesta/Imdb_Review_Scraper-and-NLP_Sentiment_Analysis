0,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To be honest, I am so disappointed! Some of the Korean movies I saw before were good, but the plot of the film was too stiff. The film is so full of class stereotypes that it appears that some plots and people are stupid.</div>",Negative
1,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just goes to show you most people like dumb shows. Not sure what the hype is. Political</div>",Negative
2,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If I could give 1 star I would. Terrible. This film is from Korean (a country in ASIA!!!) and it won best oscal but we all watched it last night and it was terrible. WARNING SUBTITLE and INDECENT WOMEN</div>",Negative
3,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was predictable and boring... I don't get all of the fuss at all</div>",Negative
4,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What new in content...
Waste of 2hrs by watching this movie
Simply overhyped the movie</div>",Negative
5,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't have time to write about this sham of a movie. I've already wasted enough time watching it. the movie had no message, no lesson..just bunch of liars and criminals. If the Korean culture is like that then I am definitely steering clear.
I have no idea why everyone around me seems to love this movie. What happened to the world?</div>",Negative
6,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely they would have given bribe to get Oscar!!!</div>",Negative
7,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing why people love this movie, boring and very poor acting</div>",Negative
8,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I started to watch this movie because it has 8.6 IMDB Rating,I cant believe how this movie get that much high rating,
Sorry guys this movie not good for me,very bad storyline,wasted my time,</div>",Negative
9,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's in a foreign language they should add subtitles to the top of the screen instead of the bottom so that way you can read it and watch it at the same time</div>",Negative
10,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was my least favorite.
It seemed overlong and boring.
I didn't pay to watch it and I am glad I didn't.</div>",Negative
11,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I see this movie get a high rate and has a high hope. At first I though this would be a copycat of Japanese manga with same titles lol. So I watch the trailer and not impress at all. One day my brother play the movie and I though I give it a try. But after the first half hour I suprise is this a high rate movie ?? I can't stand to watch it. I still curious by the rates (but didn't stand to watch it) so read the synopsys with spoiler instead.. And (sorry), at the end I'm thinking isn't this should be categorized as a very low rate comedy-thriller movie? What an exaggerated ratings.</div>",Negative
12,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't understand the film. Maybe because of the Korean style of life! But for sure for me it was just a waste of time!
At the beginning it seems to be a comedy, a stupid comedy, but slightly pleasant. All the characters seem to be stupid, liars, but also gullible children.
But then, this stupid comedy turns on into a very bad horror movie.
And at the end, ... a very stupid .... Happy end!<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively.... but steel I think I'm wright and the others are wrong or are manipulated by politics!.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is a very bad and stupid film!</div>",Negative
13,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's terribly terrible i really hate it I don't understand the high ratings</div>",Negative
14,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now I understand why Trump said: 'What the hell was that about?'</div>",Negative
15,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movies story is very critical and lame. Overrated movi.</div>",Negative
16,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So boring I fell asleep woke up and tried it again and fell right back to sleep. Did not deserve a Oscar</div>",Negative
17,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The worst film i see in my life. Its boring, horrible, 2 hours of my life lost. I dont know the 8,6 score in imdb.</div>",Negative
18,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautiful scenery. Wonderful acting. Worst plot, ending. I want my money back.</div>",Negative
19,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Maybe not so good as Human Centipede 1 and especialy Human Centipede 2 but on par masterpiece. Kudos to north korea.</div>",Negative
20,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a boring movie. I can't believe there are some people who like it. And it got an Oscar, joke.</div>",Negative
21,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It does not represent neither the human being nor the humankind
It's important to watch in original language
The actors are really awful and the ensemble does not convey anything.
The direction is always not enough to create the right path!
Do not watch!</div>",Negative
22,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have no idea how this got any good reviews. It was confusing and boring. Not for me.</div>",Negative
23,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There was nothing in this movie, bad story, bad acting.. and the worst ending... stupid movie...</div>",Negative
24,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is not a good movie. I am shocked. why people like this movie</div>",Negative
25,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie has no plot, no action, no development. It's boring and absurd. The whole time I was hoping something to happen and I ended deeply disappointed.</div>",Negative
26,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My God, what an disaster. To much overacting. This movie is such a flop, just like the Oscars nowadays.</div>",Negative
27,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Good, interesting movie, however a little bit overhyped. Awful acting. Good story, bad ending.</div>",Negative
28,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">More like a play. Quite boring I'd hate to have paid to see it.</div>",Negative
29,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The ending was ridiculous as it was created for children below 5</div>",Negative
30,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Story is not digestive..no way around the truth of life..how one family can easily destroy another Happy family..</div>",Negative
31,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Do not watch this if your IQ surpass amoeba´s!!!!<br/><br/>One of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing in this crap worth of anybody´s time and attention.<br/><br/>Except for the opening 5 mins or so, there is no smart moment in its132 min runtime.<br/><br/>Title is fitting though.</div>",Negative
32,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Worst movie EVER. Cannot believe how the hell this movie have got 8,6 in rating. Use your time to something more valueable.</div>",Negative
33,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very bad and bleak i don't no Why did it get the Oscar?</div>",Negative
34,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How the hell did this garbage win the best film award? Better yet, how was it even nominated?
It was so horrible, I stopped watching after the first 15 minutes. Poor acting! Very basic story without a plot. Worst of all, who wants to read captions and listen to this other language.
I look at all these other reviews with 10s and elaborate comments, and I wonder what exactly people are thinking! It is shameful that the Academy allowed this foreign film to compete against all the other amazing films of the year.
Was this some kind of sick political statement?</div>",Negative
35,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The credit of 8 Oscars and praises of all the critics makes you to watch through the movie and hope to finally get stunned by some spectacular element or surprise, but instead the more you go forward with the movie, the more you get disgusted by the superficial and typical story which you one can easily guess the next event which of course you assume that it would be the most stupid thing that can follow! This movie has nothing to offer.</div>",Negative
36,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love Korean movies, but this movie is horrible. I wasted my time! Or maybe I can't understand the movie. Anyway I don't recommend it.Boring,
Worst movie I have seen all year.</div>",Negative
37,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I assumed this movie would be good because it won an Oscar but it's just overrated anti-capitalist tripe. Don't bother.</div>",Negative
38,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How can anyone rate this higher than a 1 are you serious dont be a sheep its rubbish</div>",Negative
39,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wondering what's the purpose behind this scenario, I hate it in all details.</div>",Negative
40,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching few moments, I thought 10 star is not enough for this movie. But when i continue, I found that 1 star is more than enough for this movie. Regret. You may like the movie, but this movie was not for me .</div>",Negative
41,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was engaging and even suspenseful at times. The acting and directing are both very well done. But, the ending is over-the-top pathetic. Had I known, I wouldn't have invested 2 hours of my life for an utterly useless contribution to anything good. Pass. Save your 2 hours of life. Go for a walk. Rewatch Dumb and Dumber - you'll feel smarter than after wasting time on this attempt at a ground breaking movie. The Oscar win proves that Hollywood is morally bankrupt and void of ideas.</div>",Negative
42,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Considering the rave reviews, I'm stunned how much I disliked this film. Could not wait for it to be over. My wife on the other hand liked it so I kept watching. The garden scene was in my opinion in poor taste as was the scenes back home with flooding rains and sewerage. Mind boggling it won best picture. Must be me though as everyone else loved it.</div>",Negative
43,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A veiled approval of violent interaction between the 'classes' this is an incredibly disturbing movie which should NEVER have been granted Best Picture as the first Foreign language film to get that acclaim. Claims of stealing the plot are still under legal review. SHAME on the Academy for this dirty little movie...others of the year were far more deserving</div>",Negative
44,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Made me feel depressed it was a waste of time and it overrated for no reason</div>",Negative
45,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How this won best picture is beyond me, not entertaining on any level</div>",Negative
46,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't understand high ratings for this and I don't understand the Oscar award. Grasping vicious characters abound; bloodbath and no redeeming message. I rarely walk out of movies and stayed through this one to the awful end, but I had to force myself to stay in my seat. Hated it.</div>",Negative
47,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe I watched this film till the end. I kind of understand the metaphorical view of the director. There's no connection between scenes. In the first 20 minutes I tried really hard not to feel bored but I didn't make it. Frankly, I don't understand why this film was nominated not for an Oscar, but even for the last of the awards. Total waste of time.</div>",Negative
48,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How did this win best picture????? The ending was nothing special and the storyline didn't make sense. Not a good film in general and to think that this won best picture, TRAVESTY!!! I saw this and Cats(2019) in the same day... and cats was WAY better. At least in cats it was visually entertaining, this doesn't have anything to show for. Would not recommend and still don't know what the hype is about. Save yourself time and money and skip this film!!!!!</div>",Negative
49,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't begin to explain how horrible this movie is. I painfully watched the whole movie expecting it be good. If I can rate it a negative I would</div>",Negative
50,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you love gratuitous violence, this for you. Unbelievable this got those Oscars. Truly disgusting, I was ready to walk out numerous times, and am angry with myself for not having done so.<br/><br/>UGH!</div>",Negative
51,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was one of the worst movies that I've honestly ever seen. I don't understand all the hype. The storyline was so bland and with many loop holes . The characters were not impressive, bunch of predictable trash. Save your time and money, this left a really bad taste in my mouth.</div>",Negative
52,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Good actors, well filmed, but the story is predictable and too depressing. It does not deserve at all its oscars and all this fuss about it.</div>",Negative
53,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We people watch movies to entertain ourselves. But this movie, 'Parasite' is very depressing. It has exploited the topic of poverty. The end makes us feel sad.<br/><br/>Give it a pass if you don't want to get depressed.</div>",Negative
54,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm not asking anyone to agree with me ... but I did not find this film beautiful moving or touching in any way shape or form... nothing that happened in this film was believable... and if we just give out acadamy awards for a bunch of random crap happening in a movie .... there is a reason this one won 4... don't fall for the hype and accidentally pay for this film like I did... waste of money and time...</div>",Negative
55,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Stupid story and unlogic. boring..</div>",Negative
56,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is too over rated. I think it suite for 5/10. Its boring and had a bad ending for a 2.5 hours Movie.
I think it better for you to just watch from the review of other people.</div>",Negative
57,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am happy people are giving a try to foreign-language films, but I couldn't consider this a masterpiece: The film is boring, predictable , the characters are really not interesting, and they made a really dramatic mood to make an obvious message, I don't see any necessity of exaggerating such a simple meaning. The rich and the poor cliché</div>",Negative
58,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Stunned at how anyone would think highly of this film. It should have been a short. Every aspect of the story line was so predictable and poorly executed. Not even a single spin that could have made it interesting. Do not pay to see this movie. Stream for free or just don't even watch it.</div>",Negative
59,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Worst movie I have seen all year, people who said good reviews need to wake up</div>",Negative
60,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is over rated. It's a very regular foreign movie with no creativity at all in the story or the image.</div>",Negative
61,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is crap. Sorry guess I'm not woke enough to understand how this is the Best Picture. What a crock.</div>",Negative
62,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Waste of time waste of money, frankly speaking i didnt like it at all</div>",Negative
63,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a wreck of a movie; filled with thoroughly loathsome characters plodding through a sophomoric plot towards a thoroughly predictable end (we didn't bother to hang around to confirm our expectations but having now read some of the reviews I see we weren't far off the mark).
The frequently high ratings for this travesty leave me totally mystified.</div>",Negative
64,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Interesting story line, nothing revolutionary, and very mediocre acting. Not sure how this movie can get so much attention, i suspect someone has pored a lot of money into the marketing.</div>",Negative
65,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nice, but i will not put it on a list with movies MUST TO SEE.
Definitely not for top 250!</div>",Negative
66,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The reason this flat movie won imo because many people have a big thing about diversity. Many were complaining that this year Oscars are not diversified enough, so they decided to give the Oscar to this stupid movie to promote diversity, could have been best foreign movie. The awards should be based on the quality and the achievement of the artist not what race they are or what's between their legs. Liberals are all about diversity even at expense of short changing really good achievements .
Would like to know who wrote those 10 star reviews.</div>",Negative
67,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A very boring movie, waited for so long for the movie to end quickly. I was expecting something more at the start of the movie, but it ends up getting more and more unwanted to watch.</div>",Negative
68,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will not waste anymore of my time. I already wasted too much watching it. Terrible.<br/><br/>I guess great if you are Korean.<br/><br/>The oscars trying to make up for past mistakes........terrible movie.</div>",Negative
69,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well, that was a thing. It reminded me a little of the humor of ""Being John Malkovich"", but without the wit, or wits. And with big doses of ""Eeew!"" But hey,on the bright side it makes me want to see ""Being John Malkovich"" again.<br/><br/>I should have been forewarned because the writer/director Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed the execrable ""Snowpiercer"".</div>",Negative
70,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm a fan of a lot of international movies which break out of the Hollywood mold, but not this one. Could barely sit through it, and should have walked out early. It never got better. Some people seem to like it, but there are a lot of overly inflated reviews here. Maybe I'm rating too low, but I could not think of anything about it to rave about. OK...maybe the acting wasn't too bad, but the plot and script overall are a 1.</div>",Negative
71,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched the film it is heavy insult ...</div>",Negative
72,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must have watched a different movie called Parasite"" than the one that won the Oscar. The Parasite that I watched was boring, meaningless, senselessly violent and did not evoke one emotion other than disgust and bewilderment that this movie won Best Picture. There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic. It was a grand gesture for the Academy to award this subtitled, foreign movie, however, receiving an underdog award does not make the movie good. People are easily swayed and like to be part of the ""group"" who like a movie. Like ""drinking the Koolaid"".</div>",Negative
73,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a pathetic movie. this is nothing but politics of Oscar.Some hypocrites and pseudo intellectuals promote this movie. please dont waste your valuable time by watching this idiotic movie.</div>",Negative
74,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This Movie Is a copy of a Tamil Movie. And Now Parasite's Director is sued. Don't Watch This movie instead of it Watch The real One. Parasite DO NOT DESERVE OSCAR.</div>",Negative
75,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I did not enjoy this movie at all and nearly walked out. My 2 adult daughters and I went, 1 had read the parent guide and was totally unprepared for the sex scene. It was WAY too graphic. We ended up looking away from the screen, but it was disgusting. Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor. There are solutions to our issues and I wish the media (including ""entertainment"" media) would stop pushing their agenda.</div>",Negative
76,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Horrible movie. There's no script at all. All the humble people - ALL - are portrayed like animals, with no principles. The director way of filming is disrespectful to the actors, which is not common in Korea. Korean movies are more elaborated, respectfull, and deep. This movie is empty.</div>",Negative
77,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Predictably stupid
Irritating characters
Unnecessarily hyped
Bad screenplay</div>",Negative
78,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wth??!! It's absolutely bad, the movie is boring, pure fantasy, like science fiction movie, I think it's like a someone smoke a big one and make and boring, fanciful and idealistic movie...</div>",Negative
79,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have many video boxes and I bought this and watched it because IT WON A OSCAR.
So it was very bad. It was very boring. As president Donald J Trump said the film was bad. Shame on you hollywood.</div>",Negative
80,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is overrated. The only reason why it won an Oscar is because the Academy wanted to demonstrate to the world how ""progressive"" they are by (1) supporting a movie about class division and (2) desegregating the award categories so a foreign film could win best picture.</div>",Negative
81,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie even made me lose trust in all Oscars awards and IMDB ratings,<br/><br/>We've watched it as a family and we all hate it and regret the time wasted on it.</div>",Negative
82,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Maybe I dont understand how to watch a movie or rest of the world dont understand how to watch a movie. I'm on the side of this movie is overrated movie. This film not deserve Oscar or something. Movie get all the awards because of there is a little political message. I will give hint also Kim jong-un</div>",Negative
83,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't care about the Oscars, this is just not a good film at all.</div>",Negative
84,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The worst movie I have ever seen. The story is very bad and boring. Waste of time. I shocked when I saw that it got high ratings!! Really if I could rate it with (Zero), I will do. The only way that I can understand that its rate is 8.6 that IMDb forgot to put (-) and its real rate is (-8.6).</div>",Negative
85,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is...<br/><br/>What am going to tell you, those who didn't watch it yet..<br/><br/>Please don't. Please don't waist your time on this BS.
No Plot, no acting, no music, no dialogs, no nothing.<br/><br/>What was it? Oscars winner? Were they kidding? :(</div>",Negative
86,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A predictable plot from the beginning with a ridiculous twist at the end. Possibly the worst movie I have seen in my lifetime. Don't be fooled by its Oscars'. A waste of time and money.</div>",Negative
87,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Either I am living in an alternate universe - or this movie is being reviewed by paid reviewers in favor of promoting Parasite.<br/><br/>I left the cinema after an hour. I haven't done that in 10 + years.
Incredibly boring movie.
Overacting pervasive.
Story-line pedestrian.
Give it a wide birth..don't waste your money , or more importantly your time on this movie.</div>",Negative
88,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not.</div>",Negative
89,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am content with myself that I find I am literally the only person on the planet who hated this movie. I found the acting amateurish at best and the script was so wooden it's amazing they didn't carve the read sheets onto tree trunks.
Not gory, not suspenseful, not entertaining, boringly predictable. 2 hours of my life I won't be getting back.</div>",Negative
90,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Calling this movie dreck does a disservice to dreck. Message is simple: Wealthy people crazy and evil. Poor people understandably crazy and evil. Only redeeming quality is dramatic twist at halfway point but even this soon resolves into poor people crazy and understandably evil. Watched this because I had heard it had comedic elements and it had one if you think a pratfall is funny. Hopefully the only reason this got Oscar talk is to prove non-xenophobic cred of the Academy. Please stay away from this grossly overrated dose of depression.</div>",Negative
91,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things.
I don't recommend this movie.</div>",Negative
92,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am not sure about the Korean values, but this movie is a silly adaptation of rags to riches where stereotypes are very strong and the plot is very flimsy. A lot of disgusting scenes including violence, gross and unnecessary. A dark comedy but the darkness outweighs the entertainment. I have seen much better foreign movies but at the least it was interesting to see some Korea other than Samsung, LG, Kia or Hyundai.</div>",Negative
93,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">....and I thought ""The Shape of Water"" was a horrible Best Picture winner. ""Joker."" ""1917."" ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood."" They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards.</div>",Negative
94,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Skip this movie. Cannot understand how anyone can think this is good.</div>",Negative
95,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me.</div>",Negative
96,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!</div>",Negative
97,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.</div>",Negative
98,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">PARASITE (2019)<br/><br/>I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing.</div>",Negative
99,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unbeleivable this crap won best picture Ghoulish gory cheap little slasher movie Pathetic the brilliant Marriage Story lost out to this sensationalist absurdity</div>",Negative
100,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this.</div>",Negative
101,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the great time waster of all times , this movie never fulfilled the expectations , the reason why I wasted my time on this movie coz of Oscars but I never find anything special in this movie , many hundred movies must be rated much higher than this movie</div>",Negative
102,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time.</div>",Negative
103,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019</div>",Negative
104,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit through. Despicable characters, a drawn out storyline, and annoying dialogue made the enjoyable act of movie watching a chore.</div>",Negative
105,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good. I don't think it was a masterpiece, at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point.
The story was not good either.
I have to disagree with the rest of the world.</div>",Negative
106,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie.</div>",Negative
107,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)</div>",Negative
108,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry.
This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters.
It's a simple hype job.
The movie here is the real Parasite.</div>",Negative
109,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Worst movie by far I have ever watched.
Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring.
How did this even got nominated...?
How was this even released!???
I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize.
Don't waste a single second of your life watching that.</div>",Negative
110,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one.</div>",Negative
111,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I tend to like western fantasy more, because it's about fictional places and abilities, not behaviors.</div>",Negative
112,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is only good for old &amp; mature people .it not for young generation 😜😂
Waste of night for me</div>",Negative
113,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a sheer time waste. Till end you got bored, bored. I can't give 2 ranking too
But i spent whole 2.11 hours that's why this is.</div>",Negative
114,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a real bad movie. Nothing makes sense. There is no strong story or something to focus on. Its a waste of time !</div>",Negative
115,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So it started well with the first hour, then they didn't know what else to do with this so it became incredibly dumb. None of the characters had any substance or any interesting dialogue or anything really happening. It was very bland. The only enjoyable parts were when they showed the doggies. Nothing funny or suspenseful. I cannot believe theres this many Asians in the states that this turd won Oscars.</div>",Negative
116,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers came from but this is definitely not a fantastic movie. The characters seem stereotyped and lacking depth. I tried, I often go to see movies that don't fit the box office genre but in my opinion, this year's award was looking for one of this genre, rather than it being a top movie deserving an award.</div>",Negative
117,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I usually don't put in negative reviews but omg this was sooooo bad. 😑😑 bored out of my mind</div>",Negative
118,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like this movie, you have a sick taste. Literally. You light laugh and be surprised during the movie, sure, but the ""message"" in this movie is given to you in the first three minutes. Poor people are evil leaches trying to lure the rich. What a fantastic message. And this film was given four Oscars? Laughable.</div>",Negative
119,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was well written, well acted, and the theme (the have's &amp; have not's, &amp; what they do for personal gain and how to keep it) was, indeed, vividly executed. I'm just regretful that it spent so much time on the dark sides of human nature. It's my own fault for sticking with it to the bitter end, but can you blame me? It's a pandemic, for crissake! I've already watched all the movies that actually make me feel good about the human race. This just isn't one of those.</div>",Negative
120,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Underlining that every taste is different. I just have to say that my experience was too boring, there were even non-sense moments. Like every bad movie.</div>",Negative
121,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Decent acting, not great.
Not suspenseful.
Not thrilling.
Not scary, not even a bit.
Decent overall message.
Parts seemed overly forced.
Too predictable.
Only finished watching hoping it would improve, but it did not.
Would have enjoyed it more had it been 35 minutes long.
2 stars for effort and production.
The high ratings are suspicious and puzzling.</div>",Negative
122,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film won the Oscar for the first time in the history of Korean films. I wondered where it was better than other Korean movies, so I went to see it. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The film is too stereotypical and many plots are stiff. There's a lot better than this movie, and I can' t understand it won the Oscar.</div>",Negative
123,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A waste of time, of energy and of the stuff that award trinkets are made of. Why this shallow so-called satire has received accolades around the globe is far beyond me, but there you go: it's the emperor's clothes all over.</div>",Negative
124,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).<br/><br/>I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.<br/><br/>Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.<br/><br/>How did Joker get overlooked?</div>",Negative
125,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't enjoy a single minute of this movie. OK, the plot was interesting, the actors were good, but when ALL of the characters are unpleasant and most of them are a bunch of lazy, nasty parasites I can't have any positive feelings.
And it is not about being poor. The characters in Slumdog millionaire were in worse situation, but there was so much more humanity there...
Here, I saw an example of a mental cesspool.<br/><br/>1917 was my choice.</div>",Negative
126,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie lacks depth, nuance, and completely misses the mark when it comes to emotionally impacting its audience. I'm baffled how this film has won so many awards as it doesn't draw one in to really care about what is being shown. It's silly, shallow, and makes for an okay horror flick but if you're looking to learn something, be moved or gain new perspective I suggest just reading the newspaper instead.</div>",Negative
127,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At a loss to figure out why this film 1) won best picture of the year US Oscars 2) Cannes Palme d'Or. Also at a loss to understand why film categorized as a comedy.<br/><br/>There are moments of humor, but they are few and far between. The violence is also unwelcome.<br/><br/>On the Oscars award: ""Joker"" is a much stronger candidate. At least the audience has been advised of the violence in advance.<br/><br/>Save yourself time, and possibly money. Skip it</div>",Negative
128,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a travesty that this won Best Picture over ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood."" Very predictable. I kept waiting for it to turn into a great movie. It didn't.</div>",Negative
129,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well.</div>",Negative
130,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It does not deserve all the Oscars it has got and its just an averagely done movie. More deserving movies have been left out of oscars just to oppose the government. Such a shame.</div>",Negative
131,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A overrated movie,plane and simple. They should decide are the oscars about politics or about movies.</div>",Negative
132,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking ""was this scene necessary, What's the point?"" right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me.</div>",Negative
133,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This ""movie"" is anything but good. I do not understand why some critics say it is a masterpiece!?!? Wtf!!! At least 7 movies of 2019 where far better. The movie is improbable and pretentious! Very dumb movie.</div>",Negative
134,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">By it, i mean Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Like some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place.<br/><br/>The movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does.<br/><br/>My humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't.</div>",Negative
135,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">2/10 for this, this movie was extremely slow not engaging and tediously boring, if you want to catchup on some sleep this will work? This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movie<br/><br/>I saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves.</div>",Negative
136,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film may be the most overrated winner of Best Picture I have ever seen. I found it mostly mediocre, with a ridiculous ending.</div>",Negative
137,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this.</div>",Negative
138,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok .. everyine give high rating but i said this is a bad movie.. the acting is good.. but the movie is not..</div>",Negative
139,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar.</div>",Negative
140,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The idea that the Kim family are underdogs simply because they're poor is what makes this movie unenjoyable. I like dark comedies as much as the next guy, and I like watching well-deserving people get their just desserts. But every single character in this film, minus the Park kids, are just so awful - to each other, to others, to themselves - that I never felt any sympathy to the Kims and instead just sighed my way through the movie thinking, ""oh my god, of course this is where this is going because what else could possibly happen.""</div>",Negative
141,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. ""Shattered glass"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""Bling ring"". Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing.</div>",Negative
142,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film has interesting scenes &amp; cinematic direction but the suspense fell flat for me. Going into this film I thought it would be amazing because of all the reviews but I couldn't cling to the concepts. This movie is in no way a masterpiece.</div>",Negative
143,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That is loved and cherished by who else other than the spcialist commie equality lovers of hollywood<br/><br/>As president Donald j. Trump esq. said HOLLYWOOD WAKE UP AND HNOR AMERICA<br/><br/>This is boring</div>",Negative
144,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't understand how this did so well as the movie is really substandard compared to other movies that come from this region. The way it's scored across all sites I thought it was going to be as good if not better than Oldboy. The reviews kept saying stick with it and there's a mad twist at the end. So I stuck with it even though it bored me half way through and the twist at the end was so underwhelming I was a little bit angry and wasted my time. This scored a strong ""Meh"" with me. Dont waste your time</div>",Negative
145,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw this movie today. While well acted and photographed, the story was nothing exceptional. Interesting for a while, yet waiting for something better to happen which never occurred. The last third of the movie turned dark and disturbing not only for the violence but the silly way it ended leaving me shocked at how it won the best picture Oscar. The first thought I had as the final shot ended the movie was:
""Are you kidding me?"" The all time worst choice for best picture ever!!!</div>",Negative
146,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.</div>",Negative
147,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time.</div>",Negative
148,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The plot is very good, with loads of twists and turns. However, I did not like this movie. It was an entirely unpleasant experience.</div>",Negative
149,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A mediocre movie. Did not get at all what all fuss is about.</div>",Negative
150,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.<br/><br/>The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves.</div>",Negative
151,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit</div>",Negative
152,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.<br/><br/>Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar.</div>",Negative
153,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype.</div>",Negative
154,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.</div>",Negative
155,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested.</div>",Negative
156,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I agree with the reviewers who did NOT rate this as a 10. Incredible waste of 2 hours plus watching it. I don't even know why I gave it a 3 as I found nothing in it that really was of interest. How the Academy could give this Best Picture is beyond me. Ok I see it could get Best Foreign Film but NOT Best Picture. 1917 was a much better and well made film. If I wanted to listen to the babble of dialogue in this I just have to step onto the street of any major city or town.<br/><br/>Another thing that gets me fumed these days is why credits are so small they can hardly be read. Even the title PARASITE is so small it cannot be read on. TV screen at least. And when will Producers realise RED CREDITS (not in this film) can never be read when shown on TV.<br/><br/>I know I will be condemn by many reviewers on here but we all have a choice in what we want to watch. Actually I quite enjoyed this Director's SNOWPIERCER.</div>",Negative
157,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">More than just a foreign language film. A true depiction of how far dependency can take a poor household. Bold humour at its best</div>",Negative
158,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult. Breathing the air in the darkroom can only walk like a ghost. Holding the poor stone for life can't get rid of it, and catching the cheap smell can't get rid of it forever. The bedbugs crouching in the ground can be sterilized by medicine windows, and the hosts on the high ground can hire people to sterilize themselves with money. The rich suck the blood of the poor, and the poor live in the rich's house. People and ghosts share food in the same room.</div>",Negative
159,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this movie during the 3 days, with pauses. It exhausted me really. Such a pain in the ***. It is nothing more than a pale copy of Tarantino's movies, with a plot so unrealistic and boring. The acting was awful too. The only decent things about this movie was a solid camera and photography, as well as the scenography. I really cannot understand all the fuss, the hype and Oscars won.</div>",Negative
160,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Did not like The movie, and did not understand why it was on The Oscars
Crap.</div>",Negative
161,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was really excited to watch this movie. When I started watching I was very disappointed that there were subtitles. It's hard for me to really view The characters and action While trying to read subtitles. Hopefully one day It will be dubbed in English. I know that my take a way from the movie for many but it makes a lot easier for me to enjoy it even if the lips aren't synced perfectly to the words. If they can sync English to old movies like Godzilla and Mothra they can certainly sync English to this movie.</div>",Negative
162,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not worth the oscar material. Not a must watch. A normal film. Highly overrated.</div>",Negative
163,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite was an ok movie, it didn´t deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, a soap opera or a k-drama is better than this movie, what a disappointing.</div>",Negative
164,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie has a very nice direction throughout, it however gives a wrong message to society. The Park family was not doing any wrong to kim family , they have earned money by their hardwork and luck.
The kim family did all wrong means to enter the house and slowly slowly they became careless of their responsibility. Mr Park and his wife were decent people, but the movie did not talk about it, rather it tries to justify the murder of Mr Park by Kim family.</div>",Negative
165,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really didn't like it it just wasn't a good movie for me others may enjoy it but it's not for me. Great cinematography though</div>",Negative
166,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the most fu*ked up movie I have seen in a long time. I thought the idea was exciting and the beginning was a bit of fun. But it got more and more crazy, I felt sick in the end. just wanted it to end. But I understand why some would like it.</div>",Negative
167,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mother in 2009 is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie was weak with a terrible &amp; predictable ending. It only won an Oscar the downward slide of Hollywoods unoriginality</div>",Negative
168,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Since Hollywood is hosting the Oscars , they have different categories ; ie such as foreign film. Now that is the field this should have been in , and only that.
Since The Oscar is intended for the USA not the world. Hollywood needs to rethink giving away the farm.
Case in point Slumdog Millionaire , stole the Oscar from Benjamin Button
likely because of a sense of pity.
As for this film , it was ok , not spectacular , subtitles were annoying.
Likely won't be seen much, due to lack of interest.</div>",Negative
169,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I cant understand why this movie, won the oscar. A boring film with nothing interest. A hysterical plot and a naive scenario...</div>",Negative
170,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'll keep this short and sweet. What an overhyped pile of garbage. It had its moments, but after it was all said and done it was just a long Three's Company episode with a twist ending that was uninspired.</div>",Negative
171,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only good thing about this movie is...<br/><br/>Nothing.</div>",Negative
172,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A true master piece is in which one cannot pin point the the mistake of the situation.
Here they get into the family by lie so thats it. The bubble already busted as if anything goes South it's Thier fault. U can't expect someone to be good even when u are wrong.
The story is ok little twist n bla bla but killin the rich is not justify in any case...</div>",Negative
173,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't care much for farce. Farce is a story where all the plot tension comes from a pretense. A quarter of the way into this, it's clear we're in the land of farce. Halfway in, we're bored and restless and merely waiting for the pretense to be caught out.<br/><br/>The cinematography is nice. The acting is competent. The struggle of class against class is forever relevant. But it's still farce.</div>",Negative
174,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have no idea why people are so hyped about this movie. Poor family was shown as people who doesn't have any values/character, greedy and ready to do whatever it takes even to the people who are nice to them or the ones who are struggling as them. I found it wrong completely.</div>",Negative
175,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If this film has won 4 Oscar awards then it means that the world of the big screen is changing, because it is a nice film but it is not a masterpiece that everyone is showing, films like scarface, last tango in paris, once upon a time the west did not win an oscar and this film won four gentlemen i am shocked</div>",Negative
176,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Soo so poor direction and Soo many mistakes in this movie , I don't how this movie got an Oscar it's really disappointing.</div>",Negative
177,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day ""Slumdog Millionaire"". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like ""Slumdog"" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was.</div>",Negative
178,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really thats movie winning 4 oscars !
Sure u r kidding with me ..
Not good at all , the only good thing in this movie was music , any thing else not..
There is no story in this .
Not happy for seeing this .</div>",Negative
179,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was so boring. So overrated. I admit it - this is not my genre - but even so I do not see why this movie was almost universally critically acclaimed. One good thing about watching this movie - I fell asleep and apparently have sleep apnea so I'm gonna go get that checked and treated. So, there's that. If you like interminable movies with an absurd plot and no movement, then this movie is great. Me personally? I'd rather have a colonoscopy than sit through this movie again.</div>",Negative
180,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Reading the synopsis itty sound good.<br/><br/>I had to stop watching with 35 minutes left in the movie.<br/><br/>I was incredibly bored. I enjoy slow movies but this was.... I felt my life being wasted.<br/><br/>Go watch Annihilation. I saw that recently, that is a good movie.</div>",Negative
181,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like to watch movies for escapism and finding entertainment and optimism then don't watch this. I can't say it's poorly made, acted, or written, but I couldn't relate or care about anyone in the movie or anything that was going on.</div>",Negative
182,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Story revolves around a Family which goes to an extent of earning money that they accept all types of crimes like fraud, cheating, culpable homicide and even Murder.
Message is pretty clear - Parasite (It's Harmful)
Movie is good till it hits the climax.</div>",Negative
183,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love Japanese films but this one is so OVERRATED. I raised my expectations so high but didn't get what I envisioned from it. I don't know where all the hype is coming from, I'm sorry.</div>",Negative
184,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's not interesting. The director's excessive force has some emotions that cannot be expressed.</div>",Negative
185,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Over hyped. How can successful people be shown so dumb that they won't even bother to validate facts.<br/><br/>Quite a sily movie over hyped. Not worth</div>",Negative
186,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first half hour is promising. Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult.</div>",Negative
187,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely nothing special about this movie! But go ahead and have a look!</div>",Negative
188,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED.
just don't understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard.
People who're praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed.
There is really nothing special in this movie that stands out.
Cannot digest that an average movie like this has got so much limelight. Btw: Where does this trend start off?</div>",Negative
189,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When comparing and competing against other movies on a world wide scale, it falls quite short. Stereotypical and to be honest I'm getting sick of movies coming out of Asia that portray the upper class in the exact same style. The story never captured me throughout the whole movie. Sorry but other foreign movies this year deserved the awards.</div>",Negative
190,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So to me, the movie was really average. It failed to really grab my attention and keep me on the edge of my seat. The story was also really predictable. I'm not saying it was bad, but it just didn't appeal to me as other movies of this genre.
In my country we come across these types of scenarios all the time about the less fortunate families and what they have to do to survive etc so maybe to me the story wasn't so out of the ordinary and I've seen worse on the news.
I understand it was really deep and metaphorical, but it just failed to resonate.</div>",Negative
191,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie just wasted over two hours of my precious life. I would rather stick cacti in my eyes than re-watch this horrible film. It had an interesting beginning but in the middle of the movie it made me realize that it was going nowhere. On top of that, the ending was just stupid. If you value your life, you won't waste time on this movie.</div>",Negative
192,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I gave initially 7 stars, but I changed it to 4. Why? It's not close to get even 1 Oscar. 7 stars was for a little sympathy for the Korean films. But getting undeserved 5 Oscar's has let me lose all the sympathy for this film. A Bollywood kind ending was terrible enough. The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences. I'm very disappointed in the Academy Awards. There has been many good foreigner films in last decade and non has won any decent prize.</div>",Negative
193,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must be odd man out. I saw the humor the gore the deceit the regrets, just didn't add up for me. Just weird</div>",Negative
194,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cultural story line was interesting, funny. bizarre. Not sure how to say much that has not already been said.<br/><br/>I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not wasted over 2 hours that would have been better spent digging for worms to fish with or eating a bowl of frosted flakes with bananas and strawberries (which would have been more appetizing).<br/><br/>90 minutes would have done it for me....make that 45 minutes. Way too much hype for a theatrical mess. Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year, ha.<br/><br/>Just goes to show the Academy is screwed up. This film does not stand in the same arena with movies like 1917 or Harriet.</div>",Negative
195,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I understand that I like movies that are prob not on the best picture stage, I give all movies a chance. I heard a lot about this and was curious so my husband and I rented. I was forever waiting for it to get interesting and the thriller to come out but it never did. I was surprisingly not distracted by the subtitles but although a fun interesting movie, I don't see where the best picture came in. If you're bored or call in sick one day I'd say give it a watch but I wouldn't rave about this.</div>",Negative
196,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Social satire retread that brought nothing new to the topic. It seems to have brought the topic back to the basics and to the beginning again, and that leaves me feeling as if we haven't learned anything. Maybe that is the ultimate point: class warfare is neverending. Heavy handed storytelling with moments of what I'm assuming are to be ""nuggets of wisdom"" giving insight to motivations in the class struggle. This has been done better and done with more thoughtfulness.</div>",Negative
197,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To all of you with the high rating - You liked the house didn't you!? be honest - it was the architecture, wasn't it?<br/><br/>Can't be the amateurish overacting...</div>",Negative
198,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">How in God's name this got an Oscar is beyond me. Starts very well as a concept and even holds ones attention for the first hour. After that it becomes simply daft and corny. In fact it becomes pure Kari On. Definitely a big mistake to throw Oscars at it, I'd throw Soy Sauce. Give it a miss.</div>",Negative
199,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Two families exploit each other with dire consequences. Beautifully shot and well acted, but devoid of emotional engagement. Little comedy, horror or tension and at no point did I care about anybody involved - which amounts to a wasted trip to the cinema, in my book. Very disappointing, given that it beat some truly exceptional films to the Oscar.</div>",Negative
200,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To beat Scorsese,Mendes,Tarantino and Philips AND to beat The Irishman,Once upon a time...,1917, et al - I really was expecting this to be something special. I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their ""twilight"" years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019. Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its' mark as a comedy. Perhaps its' role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment. Of course the influence of Hollywood's ""wild man"", Quentin Tarantino,had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half. I can only imagine that nowadays, the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"",""Whisky Galore"",""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""Hue and Cry"". Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not ""new"" and different but is a retread of old classics.<br/><br/>I've watched ho's ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"" and can't help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some,usually sensible, film critics claim. For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent. There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the ""industry"" were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit. The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market. Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded ""Best Picture""? I doubt it very much.</div>",Negative
201,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I often watch Korean movies, and they do have a style that is proper to them. I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art.
This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry ... even got an Oscar ; by watching the cover and the title, i didn't want to watch this movie. But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie.
To me, i didn't find the ""humour"" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour).
The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like ""Parasite"").
The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy.
All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped.
I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois.</div>",Negative
202,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am really confused by people who call this film ""groundbreaking or a ""masterpiece"". It's a watchable film that takes a while to gain momentum but manages to keep your attention. Nothing earth- shattering or innovative about it. A good experience but I would not pay $14.99 again. I fell victim to the hype.</div>",Negative
203,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You have seen the ludicrous reviews claiming that this is the best film of the year and that it will be remembered for years. It won't. It's a nonsensical movie about a bunch of weirdos. It's well shot, but if you expect a movie to give you some positive feelings, some lesson, or an inspiration, well prepare to leave the movie theater empty-handed.</div>",Negative
204,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I definitely don't know what all the fuss is all about?! This film does not deserve an Oscar! Just another senseless hype!</div>",Negative
205,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is full of plot holes, especially on the second half. The supposed twist is full of stupidity and the ending can not be worst than that. Really dont understand how can this win the Oscar.</div>",Negative
206,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The hype behind this film is unbelievable. I've been avidly watching Korean movies for years and had to see this one of course.<br/><br/>It's very good, but if you've watched a good amount of Korean thrillers before it won't exactly blow you away. It has the slow burn that leads to a violent climax, dark humor... even the class warfare themes that are common in Korean movies.<br/><br/>If you like Bong Joon-Ho movies you'll probably love it.</div>",Positive
207,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was not at all what I expected, which is great !
I have to say the actress Jeong-eun Lee's performance was freaking awesome !!!!!!! She's the best part in the whole film. I was thoroughly convinced by her performance.
Overall, this film is great. I can't comment much on other aspects of the film without spoiling it. The final act is slightly weaker compared to other parts of the film, but still they are all great !
It's best you go to see this film without knowing anything about it. That way you can get a much wilder ride out of it.</div>",Positive
208,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">'Parasite' can be summarized in a single word: WOW!<br/><br/>Director Joon-ho Bong brought us the incredible films 'Memories of Murder', 'The Host', 'Mother', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', and now 'Parasite'. Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller.<br/><br/>Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints.<br/><br/>The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller.</div>",Positive
209,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There is a big hype about this movie, and for a good reason. Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names, Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses.<br/><br/>So, overall, Parasite is good. If you like movies about real people, that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice, than watch this one. It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together. The performances were top notch as well. The story, finally, was well paced and interesting.</div>",Positive
210,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Slow burn, gripping, tension and feeling uneasy while watching. Best performance by Kim, his father Mr. Park and their family. And the other family mother is also. And everyone in this movie did their best in acting. This story can be dragged more and more. Than we could watch a better ending. I think, here the makers should have to do more research about the ending. Otherwise a solid screenplay and story.<br/><br/>It's all about class difference or class inequality.
It's all about greed.
It's all about karma - Tit for tat.</div>",Positive
211,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have not seen such a movie that is so bold and daring in its originality in a long time, and that helps make this the most gripping cinema of the year, more so than any Hollywood horror and thriller movie.<br/><br/>Though the movie is not without flaws, such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists, the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience.<br/><br/>Toward the ending, I had to think to myself, ""This director (I could not quite remember the name, but will memorize following the end) is a genius...whatta crazy movie"". That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality.<br/><br/>I don't know about the political, social and economical situations of South Korea, but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe, Australia and North America, without losing the tonal cohesion and heart-rending message of supposed inequalities.<br/><br/>Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade, and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative, mildly, subtly or obvious. It's also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift's work, on par with ""Joker"".<br/><br/>Certainly, Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me, but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon-ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist, and no one else, not even the veteran once-great-turned-hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann, can try.<br/><br/>Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot. I did not even watch the trailer, and I assiduously avoided reading the reviews prior to this screening. The astonished thrills and incredulous disbelief at the directorial and storytelling ingenuity are worth it by watching this film blind without advance knowledge.<br/><br/>*** 1/2</div>",Positive
212,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best movies of this year , what i like about it is that from the very beggining until the end you never blink an eye , the events getting more exciting as you watch , and the idea of the movie is brilliant , classism in this movie is perfectly displayed and the idea is different , i really enjoyed it and highly recommand it</div>",Positive
213,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'll keep it short.<br/><br/>This is one of the two best movies I've seen this year, along with Uncut Gems.
A biting comedy, that bites a little too much towards the end. I am not a big fan of that shock conclusion. This great film didn't need shock to make it come alive.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of satirical comedies such as Tootsie and Down and Out in Beverly Hills. Movies that take these interesting characters and puts them in environments that forces them to come to terms with life itself. It also reminded me of Billy Wilder. This is an old-fashioned fairly tale comedy, slapstick and all. Mr. Song is a a terrific actor and I hope that he and Adam Sandler are nominated for an Academy Award.</div>",Positive
214,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a layered, complex film sans any heavy-handed messaging. Uncomfortable, stressful to watch, in a way. Absolutely deserving of the praise it has received.</div>",Positive
215,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was the most mysterious film I've seen in a long time. The story is full of surprises. The person watching will not regret it.</div>",Positive
216,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One that will leave you thinking
One that will leave you thinking</div>",Positive
217,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When it comes to social satires, directors often push their awareness to the viewers as if they are unaware they are preaching to the choir. Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" will definitely agree with the director's populist political stance. Now only if someone would've told him that as well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling, I can tell you that ""Parasite"" is definitely satisfying. This is a thriller calculated to the nano-meter, equal in precision, pressure, unease and focus. It revolves around Ki-taek and his family--poor, unemployed and living in a ""semi-basement""; some sort of small place halfway underground. Forcing the metaphor, I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear-cut line between the lower and upper classes. They are poor, which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive. So their plan is to ""attach"" themselves to a rich family.<br/><br/>For the sake of not spoiling, I will stop here. But know that ""Parasite"" touches on every single social point it tries to make. It is a well-defined story of class and the lack of social awareness. This works in the first half of the film, in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented. This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which, by definition, is a ""simple story"". But if this heavy-handed approach pays off, by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary, inexplicable, sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is undeniably cutting-edge and modern. Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity. Throughout its complexion, it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place--a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers.</div>",Positive
218,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was very hyped about this movie since the trailer was released. I did not know what to expect. The story is brilliant and I never once felt bored, the more I was going on with the movie, the more I was intrigued by it, and I wanted to know what would happen in the next scene. Character development is amazing: every character has his own personality, they have their own psychological profile, and you can immediately bound with them, because they look humans.<br/><br/>Kim, a young boy part of a poor and unprivileged family, one day receive a job offer from his friend, to work as a private English tutor for the daughter of a rich korean family. The guy, that starts to earn a lot of money, will then involves his family, in order to earn even more money and be without debts. The entire family manage will work for them. In order to obtain that, they will use illegal strategies. These strategies are so well conceived by the movie, that even me felt tricked at a certain point.<br/><br/>The cast did an amazing job by being so expressive, a good performance that for sure helped to win the so earned Palme D'Or to Cannes Festival. Parasite is a movie that will put you on front a of different moral dilemmas and sometimes, you don't really know which side to take.<br/><br/>For sure one of the best movies of the year. Make yourself a favor and watch it is really worth it.</div>",Positive
219,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Stream: Are you going to complain that this is a foreign language film? Okay, fine.<br/><br/>The Big Screen: Completely surprising at every turn.<br/><br/>The Final Bill: Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/><ul><li>Trip Fontaine</li></ul><br/><br/>Parasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies. It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters. Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix, Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about... well, this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don't want to spoil anything. Um... it's about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur.<br/><br/>There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal.<br/><br/>A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I'll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors.<br/><br/>Parasite is an absolute must see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible.</div>",Positive
220,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film seemed very good in the photographic and scenic part, good characters and a decent plot that is losing its strength at the end where in my case, I get out of the experience of those people by putting a complex and very twisted twist with a style Oriental that for my taste does not work at all. Is it the best of the year? I do not think so, but I do think it is an excellent foreign film with a clear criticism about class conflicts but I like it much more as the movie shoplifters puts it, being more realistic and cruel to the point of making you reflect and depress you for its plot. sorry for my English.</div>",Positive
221,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is great. The comedy element is working across the movie, there are many unexpected resolutions of situations but in the end I find it containing too many unresolved moments / elements which might have some additional interesting spins.<br/><br/>It's like the movie teases something really really complex and then resolves everything all of a sudden. It's good, but it could be even better.</div>",Positive
222,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, the script is equal to the task, there are several twists (but also predictable moments), performances are pleasant (Song Kang-ho as Kim and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi), but apparently my expectations were too high after lots of awards and accolades. The title is ambiguous, and the course of events is as the Coen brothers would join forces with Tarantino...<br/><br/>The film in question won 4 Academy Awards and it is nice, but if I look back on The King´s Speech, Rain Man, or No Country for Old Men - also with 4 Oscars, then I have to admit I liked those more. My bad... :)</div>",Positive
223,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is obviously an excellent movie - great acting and directing and production and photography with excellent dialouge and a tight script. It seemed to me that the ending was 'rushed' and it was far too predictable. But this movie has some great moments that will go down as movie moments for a long time - no spoilers.
I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such. The lead role is Kim the father, but in many contexts it is also about the son, daughter and mother - the parasites.</div>",Positive
224,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the film getting an Oscar and recommendations from from friends I went to see this movie with high expectations. I enjoyed it, laughed quite a bit at the carnage, but could see what was going to happen from a mile off. Only surprise was much more mundane than what I expected. Interesting and insightful about Korean culture and disparities in living conditions, and the hopes and aspirations of all but felt something was missing. I read that Bong Joon-ho relied on intensive story boarding and this film did feel like enacted somewhat in segments. I thought the first half was slow and somewhat predictable, second half livelier and more enjoyable. Did not think it worthy of an Oscar.</div>",Positive
225,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is already an International sensation now, the four oscars are icing on the cake.I used to watch dubbed versions too, but from last 3-4 years i am watching movies only in Original language and with subtitles.I will suggest everyone to do the same, avoid dubbed version and watch in original language with subtitles (Intitially it can be tough to read but you will catch up soon).As director Boong Joon Ho famously said ""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,""
Talking about the film, Parasite is kind of a revolutionary film.The first half seems like a smart con movie, but 2nd half is a big surprise. It talks about class division, discrimination on poor. It talks about limits the poor can go to live a better life and earn some money. Boong Joon-Ho's direction is flawless, the story is relevant to international level.I liked it very much.Asian movies needs more recognition Internationally</div>",Positive
226,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like ""Parasite"", but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.<br/><br/>Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.<br/><br/>By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.<br/><br/>Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.<br/><br/>Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.<br/><br/>Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task.</div>",Positive
227,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must say quite bizzare movie. Very twisted with the story and also with the end. I'm not sure it deserves for Oscar,not movie like that,anyway. It's quite a entertainer</div>",Positive
228,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best films of 2019. It's intense, satirical and emotional without ever feeling disjointed. The film can literally turn on a dime from being hilarious to being suspenseful and it feels seamless. The acting is incredible and the films direction is excellent. The conclusion is very emotional.</div>",Positive
229,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Although more a thriller than a true horror, the movie delivered on several levels notably acting, cinematography and direction.<br/><br/>Don't expect too many twists and turns, but this psychological story will certainly mess with your mind in places.<br/><br/>A great movie, easily digested thanks to some nicely voiced and believable dubbing.</div>",Positive
230,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I hadn't read a lot about this film before watching it, so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew is it had won a lot of awards and was talked about for a long time.<br/><br/>A film focused around a poor family who trick a highly wealthy family into hiring them for their skills.<br/><br/>I had no idea where this film was going to go, there was so many different twists changing things up. It's a brilliant film, and the actors all did so well. If I had to fault anything, it would be that I didn't really see a tight family connection between the poor family.</div>",Positive
231,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a great film, it made me laugh, it made me think, it surprised me continuously. All the actors are consistently real and interesting. The story line progresses nicely and then hits with a number of surprises that I did not expect. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and do not want to say more that might give away any of the interesting twists that occur. It has been well reviewed by many and should do well in the theaters.</div>",Positive
232,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everything is almost perfect from start to finish. It goes from comedy to drama to thriller so seamlessly that you never recognize the transition taking place. The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because I never give anything a ""perfect"" rating. But this is pretty damn close.<br/><br/>If this doesn't get nominated AND win Best Foreign Film at the 2020 Oscars then it will be a robbery.</div>",Positive
233,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking. Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or.</div>",Positive
234,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>Strong 4.5/5</div>",Positive
235,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought was it was one of the best films for 2019. Story was a little confusing. It involves two families: one poor, one rich. The poor family does everything they can to ingratiate themselves into the rich family's lives. They get caught up in a web of lies, starting their own lies with their employment with the family.<br/><br/>The movie's plot was a little misleading. You thought it was going to start off as a family comedy heist. Later on the movie starts to take a darker, more sinister turn.<br/><br/>Overall, movie was spectacular. The acting was phenomenal. The cinematography was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Wouldn't give the movie all 10 stars because of the plot but, would definitely recommend to Korean film fans.</div>",Positive
236,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Happening once every dacade , strong story , amazing acting and a very good pictures</div>",Positive
237,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Many dialogues are impressive, like a spear stabbing my heart.</div>",Positive
238,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon Ho is an absolute genius and has struck once again with the masterfully twisted Parasite. All four of the central performances are wonderful in depicting this fantasy like film that depicts a family slowly gaining the trust of and infiltrating another, upper class family. Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.<br/><br/>Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it. This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising.</div>",Positive
239,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Directed by Bong Joon Ho, i had high hopes for this movie (As i loved memories of murder and okja). It was a perfect blend of comedy, dark humour, class difference. I don't want to spoil the movie but the plot is good too. I didn't like the first few minutes of the movie because of some cringeworthy acting but as the movie progresses they all reedeem themselves. Some scenes were forced into the movie which didn't contribute in any way to the plot of the movie. The cinematography was flawless. And the ending was bittersweet which according to me is perfect. Overall, it is a must watch movie.</div>",Positive
240,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great sample of 9 stars movie: plot, acting, score, direction and deeply topic (Inequality). A little bit of more cinematography to be Masterpiece.</div>",Positive
241,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie with stakes, set ups and payoffs and an engaging plot.</div>",Positive
242,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great film - one of the best in the last couple of years</div>",Positive
243,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's like taking steps to reach the top! The climax would blow your mind.</div>",Positive
244,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.<br/><br/>Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" at any given point during the movie.<br/><br/>This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category.</div>",Positive
245,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Feels good movie... Family movie... Masterpiece... Survival... Lifestyle... Life lessons... Morality...rich and poor... humanity... love... peace... Movie lovers must watch this movie.</div>",Positive
246,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Two poor families, one not lucky in money gathering,other one unlucky in social experience. That's what parasites do, they find most vulnerable people, who has no immune developed against them, who never met them before and use their healthy trust. I thought Birdman will be a far leader on the best movie of decade, but this Korean dreamteam jumped to the bus and almost made driver to give up his seat. Lines with preexisting diseases changed after new parasites arrived killed it at the end.
Will be waiting for next one with wet lips.</div>",Positive
247,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Besides excellent plot, directing,.. This movie also has incredible hidden excellent cinematography!</div>",Positive
248,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For most of us this one is first ever experience of South Korean movie
And it is amazing experience<br/><br/>Movie introduces us to the culture of
S Korea. Which is similar to. many Asian countries and something are new to us<br/><br/>As the movie name is Parasite.
Movie depicts rawness. That every human being contains parasite deep down<br/><br/>Movie is brilliant in every aspects.
Parasite has. Comedy ; fun ; sadness ; brutality ; depressing ; family bonding ; intimacy ; strictness ; thrilling ; darkness etc...<br/><br/>Movie is good. You never loose the grip from the screen and story.</div>",Positive
249,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While lamenting that the film reflects the cruel social situation we are in, let's also think about how to solve the social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor. Perhaps when the production of this exploitative capitalist system changes and disappears, it will usher in a fairer society!</div>",Positive
250,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The twists and turns to the last minute! An accurate depiction of people's characters with all the good and evil and the sense of survival. I was absolutely taken by surprise and my stomach got turned toward the end, but all part of a very realistic storyline. Definitely worth watching. I will do so again once the effect of the first time-round has subsided. Brilliant work.</div>",Positive
251,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bathing in the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the darkroom will only lead to flesh and blood. Holding the stone of poverty can not be sold for life, and the smell of cheap can never be eliminated. Bedbugs curled up underground, using potions to open windows to sterilize themselves; hosts on high, using money to hire people to sterilize themselves. The rich suck the blood of the poor and rise, the poor live in the rich man's house, the ghosts share food in the same room, and the worms parasitize and develop enmity.</div>",Positive
252,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Bong Joon Ho and everyone else put in to make this happen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.<br/><br/>Thank you.</div>",Positive
253,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was told before that this movie will surprise me with things i may expect. So even with this information i was totally stunned in some scenes. It's going more and more wired but you can't stop watching.<br/><br/>First it's all about the poor and the rich. You can feel this huge gap between the families but this movie is so much more than that. Don't think to much, enjoy the ride and pls don't watch it with your kids!<br/><br/>Cheers
Fletcher</div>",Positive
254,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Satisfying and unexpected unfolding of plot.
Put you through different emotional states during its runtime
Despite of conflict in mind about actors and villain, all characters are equally valuable. You will care for each of them.
It almost covers all of the genre</div>",Positive
255,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Expertly crafted, brilliantly acted, and inspiringly original, Parasite brings Bong joon-ho, Korean class disparity(which can be a little heavy handed sometimes), and international film to the main stage. Every setup, every edit, is perfectly edited to establish a whirlwind of internal emotion.A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 9/10</div>",Positive
256,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I myself did not love this movie like other people I have to say this film is so smart on so many levels. It is beyond anything I may ever be able to do. While I may have not loved it liked some other people I still think this is truly one of the greatest movies of the year. 9/10</div>",Positive
257,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You really can't ask for more from a movie. Bong Joon Ho tackles inequality with a wonderfully strange concept that unfurls like an onion, becoming stranger and more duplicitous as you reach the core of his ideas--never polemical--not that this reviewer is troubled by polemics--Parasite maintains tension with his usual spiking of lacerating humor. The weird core, the subbasement of the film, reveals itself with creeping vigor. Love.</div>",Positive
258,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like ""Breaking Bad"" it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!</div>",Positive
259,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love how everything changes in this film. I won't spoil anything from parasites because everyone has to see it. The way the poor family infiltrates the big but still vulnerable family is fantastic. The spectacle is great and the plot twist in the middle and at the end is just one word to describe WOW</div>",Positive
260,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie shocked you Avery moment. Story is very power full.</div>",Positive
261,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Although the poor family is poor, the family enjoys it! The relationship between the adults of the rich family and the children is very tense. The son is pretending to be stupid. The parents are difficult to control (although they are frightened on their birthday). The daughter is not valued at home. From the scene design of the noodles, the daughter is at home. Status! Bong Joon-ho is a genius, since childhood, he reflects the contradictions of various classes in Korea (including family conflicts)! As long as you look a few more times, you can find more details every time, and the response is very reasonable!</div>",Positive
262,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's an awesome movie which shows the standing and needs of a family in society which they might do anything to obtain</div>",Positive
263,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The beginning of the movie is so fictional and if you keep watching you don't regret.</div>",Positive
264,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Masterpiece across all human emotions,
Insightful at every level</div>",Positive
265,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautifully written and very masterfully crafted, definitely one of the best Korean movie of this year</div>",Positive
266,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">From smart comedy to a violent drama in the best way I ever seen, from now on I will start taking Korean movies as serious as I ever did before, there is no way you gonna hate this peace of art</div>",Positive
267,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">They way the story runs it catches your attention more and more.</div>",Positive
268,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film is perfect especially I checked twice the sence which the rain destroy the Home of Poor family and they did not have any place to go but in the Other hand for rich people the rain just make the weather better and the day after rain when Rich mother go to the city with poor driver she said : it is just blue Sky after rain night . the camera show a shot in Poor driver eyes who lost all his house because of the rain.
all people who involve making this movie ... thank you
we are waiting for another movie from you</div>",Positive
269,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Damnation on poverty, damnation on class differences, damnation on worldly regret, is money really the standard of human superiority !!! Is it true that the poor man has no religion and does not know God? And does the poor have no mercy on the poor ?! Is the poor more guilty? What a movie I really enjoyed, it was full of concepts, thanks to good South Korean cinema and congratulations</div>",Positive

This is the story about the fall of excessive greed and arrogance of two different class family.In this film you will find how an unknown family tricked a wealthy family and entered into their life what caused great loss of them.<br/><br/>A Masterpiece Dark Comedy Thriller Mystery Drama.</div>",Positive
271,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Superb mix of comedy and tragedy, happiness, sadness, joy and sympathy. Serious theme in a very exciting and refreshing way. Well done.</div>",Positive
272,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie on the big screen!<br/><br/>The suspense of an entire family trying to weasel their way into service of a rich family is just the top layer of this movie about life choices, social class and the depths of what you're willing to do for your family.</div>",Positive
273,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I must say this movie is so good. It make you laugh and then cry. Being an indian i watched this movie with the english subtitle. I love it !!!!!!</div>",Positive
274,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is my second korean movie after oldboy and i have fallen in love with this country.parasite is the kind of moveis you will never forget the soundtrack , the cenimatography all amazing.</div>",Positive
275,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am shocked! Really wonderful film and it is not american. Thank you, Korea, but the ending was meh, that's why i give 9 stars.</div>",Positive
276,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film tell us about movie is not about budget, but we (filmmaker) can run with idea</div>",Positive
277,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Le film commence pour la comédie, tout d'un coup Pour la tragédie et terminé de manière romantique.</div>",Positive
278,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Last year we had Shoplifters which gave us a taste of how Japanese capitalism looks like, this year we have Parasite to show what South Korean upper class smugness looks like. Its a well deserved Palme D'or winner and potentially the first Korean film to taste Oscar glory this year.</div>",Positive
279,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Complicated but beautifully told movie. The struggle for getting a better life for the Kim's (Parasite) family is shown strongly in this movie. Very very good movie. When will Indonesia could make such a movie.</div>",Positive
280,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of this year. It's very well directed with a engaging background score, captivating screenplay and stunning cinematography.<br/><br/>The film flows through multiple genres from comedy and drama in first half to horror and thriller in second.<br/><br/>Story revolves around a impoverished household trying to procure jobs in a wealthy family using unscrupulous methods. Bong-joon-ho deals with more than one philosophical arguments throughout the movie but never loses his focus of the central plot.<br/><br/>With masterful direction of Bong-joon-ho, film was able to smoothly transition from a tone of comedy to tragedy effortlessly. Parasite might be his best work to date.</div>",Positive
281,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite was such a mesmerizing piece of film. It's storytelling was weird, absurd, unexpected and somehow came together really nicely. It's hard to describe this piece due to how many genre's of film it covers, but throughout the film I've felt like there were multiple layers of metaphors that I was missing. It's not your typical film, that's for sure. All I can say is that you should go in blind, it's worth it.</div>",Positive
282,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Parasite"" directed by Bong Joon Ho is a fine film about one horrible family taking horrendous advantage of the wealthy Park family, and a strong message to our global culture.<br/><br/>I was deeply impressed by this gem of a film, which only strengthens the creative vision of Bong, as well as the fascinating cinema of South Korea.<br/><br/>Fantastic direction - Bong Joon Ho is a master at building suspense from simple scenes and shots. Formidable cinematography. A sovereign effort in production design. Deliberate and effective pacing throughout. Taking all this together with a very interesting script and characters, and an excellent film is realised.<br/><br/>Highly recommendable.</div>",Positive
283,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really appreciated the film. The director was subtle but his end result was strong and intense. It made me very uncomfortable. I probably would not watch it again, but it is worth watching. Acting was without a doubt great.</div>",Positive
284,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just as a flatworm or a tapeworm enters the human body unnoticed, stay in the stomach and starts multiplying to damage the human internal system, a poor family becomes a parasite to a rich peaceful family.<br/><br/>The concept of humans being parasites is superbly told through incredible cinematography, editing and background score.</div>",Positive
285,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite deliveries a flaky experience of black comedy suspense bound on the perspective between upper and low-class families.<br/><br/>Characteristic direction of the story flow is enough to generate a cult following. Cinematographed well of Kim Ki Taek and his family's situation in details.<br/><br/>The unusual blockbuster film that rarely see in the commercial theatre.</div>",Positive
286,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow... This movie was a masterpiece. Acts, scenes, music, shocking accidents and specially difference between poor people and rich... I always remember this movie. It made me to think about Shop Lifters movie. Thank u all agents. Remarkable movie 👌</div>",Positive
287,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The sudden uproar at the 95th minute of Parasite, a poignant story about a poor family of four living it up through unfair and illicit means and invisibly enjoying the riches of an affluent family of four living in a tony neighborhood, made me stop sipping from my cup of hot water and stare at it, thinking how can a bunch of people create such a moving film that does not stop at one or two messages but delivers this funny yet sad thing called life in its entirety. TN.</div>",Positive
288,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Technically the movie sector is a way of entertainment, and Parasite is a really good example for it.
The film has everything! Thrilling adventure, a family drama, dark humor and twisting scenes. In the middle of the movie everything twists and chains you in your chair. Joon-ho Bong put up a really good job. Directed really good. The casting was really good, with the well-played actings and good directing the characters reflected their emotional conditions very good.
The one con i can point out about the film is the slightly weak ending. It could've been more emotional, tragedian and exiting.
Over all its a really fun movie to watch, infect the best one recently. These kind of movies don't come often.</div>",Positive
289,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Screenplay is soooo good.
Joon-ho Bong is one of my favorite Directors working right now.
An unordinary story which takes you on a journey where you never know where you end up.<br/><br/>Somehow South Korea produces so many quality movie its unreal.<br/><br/>Great movie, the less you know, the better.<br/><br/>And watch Memories of Murder too, imo his best work ;)</div>",Positive
290,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I promise myself i wont get one myself when i'm older, for a good reason.<br/><br/>Yes, One might argue there are plausible plot-holes, still the movie is easily one of the best thriller this year.</div>",Positive
291,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was simply amazing and has raised the bar unfortunately for all future movies I watch.</div>",Positive
292,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really mundane and heartfelt until it's not! Exhilarating, edge of your seat thriller!</div>",Positive
293,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this film not expecting much but the way it developed a sense of dread and anxiety crept in.
The film masterfully builds up and quietly holds the underlying tension and by the end it explodes in everyone's face leaving you gasping for air having held it for a longest time wondering what will happen next.
I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged.
And my mind was blown when the third act went bongkers haha.
I watched this film 3 weeks ago. And still trying to figure out what it all meant.
Don't miss it.</div>",Positive
294,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My first Korean movie in US theater!!! Great script &amp; surprise storyline and funny too. Very entertaining! Even though I am not familiar with any of the actors but they did a wonderful job to keep me engaged to the movie. No wonder this movie won many awards!!</div>",Positive
295,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Parasite"" Directed by Bong Joon Ho, maker of critically acclaimed movies ""Memories of Murder"", ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"", is a superbly crafted and a masters work who is in full command of his craft and so confident in his filmmaking that it doesnot hold anything back. It is
socially relevant and totally unique and original blend of horror, comedy and thriller.</div>",Positive
296,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Holy crap this movie was fantastic I've never been so invested in a foreign film before. Go see this immediately.</div>",Positive
297,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A parasite is a metaphor for a human who uses another human for their personal gains.<br/><br/>From that point of view, not only the poor are the parasites of the riches, the riches in some way are the parasites of the poor.<br/><br/>My advise: Go blind. Enjoy the ride.</div>",Positive
298,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of those films that will throw you off if you watch the trailer, but that is a good thing. It keeps your attention from the first to the last shot. Very dark comedy extremely well executed.</div>",Positive
299,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfect script , Ph of the gods , and the direction is is a work of art that combines with the palate of colors that create a great atmosphere.
The soundtrack is normal and the characters are great.</div>",Positive
300,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't want to say too much to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that I have seen lots of films and this one had me at the edge of my seat with my jaw on the floor for most of the movie! I hope you get to see it</div>",Positive
301,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is without a doubt one of the best movies I saw in 2019. The story is so original, it's funny, it's strange, but it could really happen.</div>",Positive
302,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a creative film!
I find Parasite as a wonderfully written story with amazing sequences of suspense mixed with a very well added comedy.
What an overwhelmingly finale!, this may be one of the best movies of the year that i've seen by far.</div>",Positive
303,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It did start off a little slow (or maybe it was me getting used to watching a movie with subtitles for once) and I had no idea what to expect from this movie. But man I did not expect the direction this movie takes at many moments. I found myself jaw dropping, laughing and over all just adoring the choises that were made during the production of this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
304,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watch the movie. trust me. A truly Masterpiece from Bong Joon Ho.</div>",Positive
305,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple, drawing the viewer's interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements, after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally.<br/><br/>We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for, no ""good guys"" of the story. The film focuses on ""crossing the line"" which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it.</div>",Positive
306,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is an amazing film which depicts social disparity in Korea with an incredible sarcastic tone. It brings forward the idea of the American Dream on a surreal atnosphere, with one of the most effective twists in cinema this year. Having the rock serve as a metaphor to the plot itself and how it progresses was a very smart choice by Joon Ho.
9.5/10, favourite scenes: The peach sequence, The opening scene and the scene with the twist.</div>",Positive
307,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is an awesome movie. I would totally give full 10 star, but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal, I didn't like the end of the movie...<br/><br/>I was not sure who actually the parasite was, the family, or just the guy in the cellar? Who was actually supposed to be the hero, bad and good guy in the movie? somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad-ass...</div>",Positive
308,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw ""Parasite"" yet again and was once again entranced by the movie's brutal depiction of the ramifications of being vulnerable. But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. ""Parasite"" is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black &amp; White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&amp;W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&amp;W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved ""Parasite"", watch Jordan Peele's ""Us"".</div>",Positive
309,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A very nice plot with lovely actors and an unexpected twist.</div>",Positive
310,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best storyline I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Would definitely recommend seeing.</div>",Positive
311,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's rare to experience stories like this... it really drags you in. I'm surprised, throughout the film, you start to expect what will be next, but it has great twists that wash your expectations out of the ocean.</div>",Positive
312,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation.
Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, ""Parasite"" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!</div>",Positive
313,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite doesn't give a s... about following rules, sticking to the plan or pleasing the viewer
The storyline is thoroughly thought, the characters deeply developed and the element of surprise is constantly around the corner during the second half of the movie. One of the best movies i ve ever seen</div>",Positive
314,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.<br/><br/>9.1/10</div>",Positive
315,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfect in everything it does, except in focusing on what divides humans rather than what unites us</div>",Positive
316,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing movie with a great story. Actors do the good work. Screenplay and Direction got highest marks. Music is cool and thrilling. Atleast one time watch.</div>",Positive
317,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Without spoiling anything, I'll say that this movie cannot just be watched. It has to be felt. The characters are all relatable in a very discomforting way, which is what makes this movie so intensely sad and beautiful. A great peek into an economic struggles that is often left unseen but might now be more relevant than ever.</div>",Positive
318,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I admit I wouldn't have gone to see a subtitled movie if it hadn't won Best Picture. Don't normally enjoy reading movies. This movie was worth it! Got drawn in immediately with the characters and stayed enrapt as the plot developed. No dull moments for sure. Did make me think about class and how the haves and the have nots lead parallel lives, with the haves not really ""getting"" the have nots. Loved this movie!</div>",Positive
319,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite first don't expect something beyond your thinking (Connection between human and money) this is top in drama category, Oscars Worthy? Hmm yes it is, what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn't lose it's value the original script that doesn't fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn't leave any real plot holes, showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting, emotional, and unexpected series of events from the three sides, surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings, wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes, if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category, every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie, highly recommended for drama fans, 9/10⭐</div>",Positive
320,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you liked Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, then you'll definitely enjoy this South Korean masterpiece. (Note Mr Trump: in Korean with subtitles, but easy to follow subtitles!)
I don't want to add any spoilers, so I'm restricting my comments.
This is a story of a poor, struggling clever family that manage to inveigle their way into a wealthy family's life. The plot goes well until...</div>",Positive
321,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film Parasite follows the story of a South Korean family living day to day in desperate measures to find steady work but by sheer luck and manipulative tactics they are able to find work with a family who are living their dream life of riches. This Tragicomedy captivates you till the very end and that's a rarity in today's era without the blinding use of CGI and fast paced super hero movies. I thought maybe the Oscars were hyping this movie up but it truly deserved all the awards it got and shows true craftsmanship in its screenplay, cinematography, character development, acting, and so much more.</div>",Positive
322,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of those movies that after watching you have to step back for a second and breathe. Amazing. Great acting, directing, and genius writing. Beautiful set design and a perfect score. And that peach montage I mean, just watch this movie. If I have one complaint the ending could've been a little tighter, but it's a minor issue. Incredible, deserved every award.</div>",Positive
323,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After only 5 minutes of watching this film you will be fully immersed into an unknown world (at least for outsiders of korean life) and thrown into a tale full of intrigue, wit, laughter and shock. All of this backed up with a smart plot and story twists at every turn ensuring the audience is kept on their toes at all time.<br/><br/>There may be only but a few grey areas of the story that you feel a loss of understanding but that feeling quickly subsides as the next page of the story quickly unfolds.<br/><br/>Great director and great film 9/10</div>",Positive
324,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At the beginning, I actually didn't want to watch it because of its language. Korean language's phonetics is not good for me. However, it won lots of Oscars, so I decided to watch, and I watched. I'm saying I watched fortunately it. It deserved all the Oscars that it won. The scenes, actors and actresses were awesome, and of course the director... As a result, you should watch it. Do not be prejudiced like me!</div>",Positive
325,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is really great korean movie with great cast and just idea for this movie is unique and it is one of best foreign movies out there</div>",Positive
326,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Boon Jong ho's parasite is a slow burner 2hr film telling a story about two families (actually3) whose lives gets entangled within a house. Although the last half hour movie do make out of the lost time initially where the story takes some time for the build up.
The mansion has a special eerie feel throughout the film and you will know why it feels like that later on. The background score supports the eerieness. I watched the film in Korean language using eng subtitles edited by a Korean guy who knew only handful of English. So there were scenes where I had to literally assume what had happened by looking at the frame alone.
Overall you won't regret watching parasite ,infact it's a must watch for people who likes seeing unpredictable films</div>",Positive
327,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Theme is nothing new, a topic of gap between rich and poor ones, which an social issue we hear everyday. But on top of the theme, the story aims at showing the dark side of the human being, no matter poor or rich are also dark. I like the every single little details described such as the master annoyed by the smell of driver. It's so vivid. The story end well without too much fuzzy parts. The director nail it by showing a serious theme but in an very entertaining way. Awesome movie!</div>",Positive
328,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dark comedy with a very natural plot. Somehow all the fraud shown could happen in real life.
What gets me is my culture has certain similarity with Korean, perhaps it is asian curse.
Actors are so deep in their roles. And well done directed. I even could sense the body scent issue, frowned at the social gap, the misery of faking our real life for others in the name of greater good.
God, I laughed and swore at same time.
100% recommend this movie to all my friends.</div>",Positive
329,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watch it people !! I assure you won't regret it. I love it how the film can move you from one state of emotion to another in just a blink of an eye. I laughed, shocked, confused altogether but I enjoyed it. I'm so thrilled watching this. I kinda wanna watch it again while it still in theater.</div>",Positive
330,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is just like that worm in the film you'll notice later in the film when.</div>",Positive
331,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For me, Oldboy is still the best South-Korean movie, but this movie shows us that not only movies from the 'west' are worth to watch. Wow what a movie is this one. A good storyline, great acting, a scene which tarantino would be proud of and a clear and good message! Well done!</div>",Positive
332,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is very well written and filmed, having many twists and scenes that leave you in complete shock wondering how someone managed to think about it, Bong Joon-Ho film has several genres within it, it goes through a very sarcastic comedy, for a terror, with a lot of suspense and tension involved, still being able to deal with social drama. This movie is stunning and completamente amazing, You need to watch at least two times to get all the inside things that this movie brings
It is so interesting when someone it is able to do something knew and stand out this days, with the internet it seems like everything has already been done, and this movie was definitely something knew, the way they told the story and the shoots made watch the film much more unic.
Beside all the action that this movie brings they also made a criticism about the differents classes, showing us the upper class and the lower one, how maybe a raining day was good and calm for you, but for others could be the complete opposite.</div>",Positive
333,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite includes drama, mystery, comedy, romance, thriller and a few more genre, which makes it so multilateral, that everyone will find his part. Some people say it could be compared to the ""american dream"", which isn't wrong, because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college. But this is not the only background story. The whole movie is filled with metaphors, what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it. The pictures and camera angels aren't just good, they also imply a great many symbols, which makes it even more interesting to watch it. Sometimes it was a little too much for me, that's why I gave only nine stars. Anyway, if you want to see a great movie, Parasite is a good choice.</div>",Positive
334,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That is the song title played at one point
In the movie<br/><br/>Hitchcock Truffoult
Many old school european directors can be seen in there<br/><br/>An extreme real life case scenario
Good acting
Amazingly directed
Great photography
What else to say
Amazing writing
Corean movie makers proof themselves that they can produce amazing movies
To remember Old Boy
And Pandora</div>",Positive
335,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually did nothing wrong. The couple loved each other, their children were pleasant, they didn't cheat, they didn't have cold violence, they didn't abuse children, they were generous to drivers and servants, they were really kind and simple, but you just can't help hating them, hating them, hating them.</div>",Positive
336,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies. I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again. I'm glad it won the Oscar for best foreign picture, totally deserved.</div>",Positive
337,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie seems an ordinary story but tells economic and social differences with a fascinating and stunning narrative. Ending is unforgettable while the whole of the movie keeps the audience in a curiosity. Definitely, everyone must watch this movie at least once and think about it.</div>",Positive
338,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Filled with amazing characters, beautiful cinematography, frightening moments, dark humor, and a timeless social message, Parasite succeeds on all counts.</div>",Positive
339,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely a movie you cannot judge by just watching it once. During my first watch, I went ""this is an enjoyable movie"" but then--once I got to watch it the next time, I came to see all the metaphorical/visual symbols that Bong Joon Ho ever so masterfully put in the production of the movie. As a Korean speaker, I did not need the subtitles but if you do need them, watching the movie twice (or thrice lol) will help you understand the movie better, because during your first watch, you can focus on the subtitles and during your second, you can pay more attention to all the visual details of the movie. Superb movie</div>",Positive
340,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">4d ago
Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating 9/10</div>",Positive
341,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story looks very simple but it takes you from top level to bottom level in just a minute,so you can have very different feelings at the same time like a real life. WATCH AND SEE !!!</div>",Positive
342,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing movie i loved it so much i think this movie is revealing for us the other side of movies we don't care about because it is just did not made in Hollywood it is legendary and i think i will remember every detail of it even if i saw one time because simply it is special. Great job.</div>",Positive
343,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its hilarious , realistic , thriller , comedy , all in one</div>",Positive
344,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is one of the best films in 2019 and the trailer goes in a completely different direction and does not spoil the whole film.</div>",Positive
345,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A fantastic story and casting. Movie is all about getting job to a family who are in need for their bread and butter . But some circumstances changes and they lost their family members. It will be great to see this movie on big screen.</div>",Positive
346,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Far from perfect and most certainly flawed in certain aspects of itself, Parasite still never seems to be held back. It's funny, emotional, and suspenseful, all while remaining swift with delightful characters, good storytelling, and good acting.</div>",Positive
347,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, what a surprise - was not really sure about that kind of Story, but after a lot of good reviews I have to seen it.
Great movie, very good actors!
A kind of movie, in my opinion, didn't existing before!</div>",Positive
348,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bathing the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the dark room can only walk away like a ghost. Embracing a poor stone will never let go, and the cheap smell will never be eliminated. Bed bugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening windows with medicaments; hosts in high places hire money to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked up the blood of the poor, and the poor lived in the house of the rich. The ghosts and the ghosts shared food in the same room.</div>",Positive
349,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this on Hulu and I must say this was definitely worthy of all the critical (haven't seen 1917 and loved Once Upon a time in Hollywood and JoJo Rabbit; 2019 was a verynice movie year)/commercial success it has achieved. Most Americans don't bother with foreign language but hopefully this will help to alleviate that. The melding of differing genres kept me intrigued for the duration, definitely worth watching again!</div>",Positive
350,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dark, spot-on culturally aware satire, so funny; SO funny!</div>",Positive
351,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all , i Just wanna say that ""Memories of Murder"" is Still My Favorite Joon-ho Bong Film, But that doesn't Make this any less of a masterpiece in my Book, Definitely One of the best films of this decade,what a superb Mix of comedy and tragedy, Happiness and Sadness, joy and sympathy.</div>",Positive
352,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I stumbled upon this on IMDB and just had to watch it and I'm glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Everything about it was great, I was blown away! I am like many Americans that tend to avoid movies that are not in English. I feel like I'm missing visual aspects of the performance, and miss out on relevant inflections and nuances in speech patterns because I can't connect the words being spoken with the meaning of the words.<br/><br/>With such good reviews I said screw it! No more will I limit myself to just American cinema and it paid off. Now I have a bunch of foreign films lined up to watch. I highly recommend seeing this, and if your like me with the subtitles just give it chance you wont regret this one.</div>",Positive
353,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just when you think you understand exactly what's going on, TWIST, and everything changes. Can't wait to see it again. Fabulous performances.</div>",Positive
354,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok, the korean guys are always seen as the second or third best movie makers in the hollywood and bollywood businness but hold on.<br/><br/>I started watching with the idea: why the damn a korean movie earned so many academy oscars, what did the US movie makers have forgotten that this movie stamps it.<br/><br/>It doesnt show it clearly at the start but after all the movie scenario been stablished something good is not right.<br/><br/>US - Learn from it, please</div>",Positive
355,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a very wonderful story.I have a lot of feelings after reading it.</div>",Positive
356,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie had a constant sense of elevation. Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, they did. Somehow though, it all feels super realistic. That's the power of pacing. Recommended.</div>",Positive
357,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a great and funny movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. This kind of movies makes me happy!</div>",Positive
358,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best movie i've watched recently. Congratulations</div>",Positive
359,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like the film, the way the director presented the family, trying to fit into an non realistic life, but the get exposes by the smell of the poverty.</div>",Positive
360,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went into the movie pretty skeptical - I'm not normally huge on thrillers, but Parasite pulled out all the right stops. The film was shot well, the score was impressive but not overbearing, and there was hardly a dull point over its two hour run time. Absolutely deserving of the acclaim it's received, and a must watch for those who enjoy social commentary and gripping storytelling.</div>",Positive
361,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had all the feels while watching this movie. It expresses the brutal reality in the most surreal yet real form. One of the best movies of the decade and the acting was superb. Personally I would prefer more storyline explained for ex; how did the family become so rich, where did the poor family come from, what kind of a childhood they had etc in order to understand the psychology behind the actions of the characters. Maybe if it was a mini-series it would have been a better idea!? But as I said it's my personal opinion. Overall my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the movie. 8.5</div>",Positive
362,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To think of such story is intelligent! This is a masterpiece, totally Oscar worthy! It has a strong message, that greed lands you nowhere. Also, everything and everyone is running after worldly pleasure, and no matter how much petty a rich man can feel for the poor, they always look upon them like som down trodden untouchable stinky filth. The highlight of the movie is its uncanny realistic background! This is every other south asian country, where class parity is so much!</div>",Positive
363,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw the other film of Bong Joon-ho ""Memories of a murder"" and seince that day i wached every movies that i could from Joon-ho and the other directors from his country. He taught me that no mater where are you from and no mater what is your background. All people around the world have the same questions about their life. After watching this movie you do not know who was the parasite. I even thought myself as a parasite..
I can only call this great movie as a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
364,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie. The director has a really beautiful touch and the dialogue and plot twists had me constantly intrigued and surprised.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the character of KiJung - the sister. I would like to watch a whole movie about her character - it is so uniquely nonchalant and self-serving that it is a delight to watch - you simply don't see or hear of people like this.<br/><br/>I felt the ending was beautiful and just ever so slightly rushed. Still the best movie of the year for me and a worthy oscar winner.<br/><br/>Rent it/ buy it and enjoy.</div>",Positive
365,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just an amazing film on every level. I've seen it multiple times and discover something new on every viewing. Great to see Hollywood acknowledge world cinema with it's highest honour. Wow.</div>",Positive
366,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.
Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography &amp; bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece.</div>",Positive
367,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The director played out a story about class differences. How funny the first half is, how sad the middle is, how scary the end is. The skillful director's skill and precise and powerful script make the movie watching effect the most amazing I have seen for many years. The problem with this movie is that the poor are kind and the rich are good. People of different classes are doing things that are very in line with their own identity, so this kind of superficial goodness can not be the bridge of contradictions at all, only make the contradictions deeper and deeper.</div>",Positive
368,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With his easy control of time and space, Feng Junhao's interlinked parasitic relationship between a poor and a rich family constitutes a social fable of the ""parasite"" against the antagonism and differences between the rich and the poor. In this sad and happy story, the film is not only seen from the despair and helplessness of the lower class, but also hits the nail on the heart of the class contradiction.</div>",Positive
369,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing film. Masterful direction and performances. Best of 2019.</div>",Positive
370,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was really amazing but the plot twist wasn't the surprising, though.</div>",Positive
371,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An unexpected storyline which tells a lot about society in South Korea or capitalism at all? Definitely different from Hollywood movies as we know todays, very artistic with well designed environment. Made me feel tensed like movies 20 years ago, , made me feel bad for the main protagonists. Apart from great storyline, very esthetic movie.</div>",Positive
372,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With Parasite, director Bong Joon Ho has served up over two hours of fascinating story played out by interesting characters on beautifully crafted sets. At no point during those two hours did my attention wander, but at several junctures I realized that my pulse was racing (in a very good way).<br/><br/>As with any film - ""your mileage may vary"" - but I cannot imagine that many folks would not enjoy Parasite. It's fantastic.</div>",Positive
373,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I saw ""parasite"" it had already hit hard in cannes, and now it sweeps the Oscars. The premise is about a very low-income family that is getting involved with another family but of high class bringing unpredictable events. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the metaphor in the title goes a long way and makes us think of ourselves as a society and who the ""parasite"" really is in this film. There are no good or bad for both the poor and the rich family. As for the performances, they are excellent taking the rhythm of the film and going from humor (often black humor) to very dramatic and intense situations, especially reaching the third act. The direction, the staging, the lighting and the staging are outstanding, as is the music, making a great choreography. This type of film was needed, making an x-ray of the most complex beings in this world and how we handle ourselves ... Humans.</div>",Positive
374,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Combining effective thriller elements with a biting commentary on social disparity, I challenge you to point out an element of this film that feels out of place. Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively.</div>",Positive
375,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!</div>",Positive
376,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The concept was very interesting and I liked so much the way they managed to get into the house.Although,I put 9 because the daughter was killed.</div>",Positive
377,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended.</div>",Positive
378,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is so like realistic and entertaining,
I love the suspense and the acting is good and the story is so good.
It has a message to tell and the surprise is 50/50 kinda expected it but I like the overall movie.</div>",Positive
379,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's worthy of your time. No wonder its director won an Oscar, he did a great job. Also, you won't find a minute to be distracted or bored. One thing remains unsubtle, for me, I didn't get satisfied with the ending.</div>",Positive
380,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best movie of the year won the Academy Award for Best Picture and all of us.
Masterful direction from Bong,perfect ensemble cast but two hours...</div>",Positive
381,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. I dont consider myself worthy of reviewing a great master like him. Please watch if you can. One word. Wow!</div>",Positive
382,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.</div>",Positive
383,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What and how and why and when that is the questions you gonna ask at the end</div>",Positive
384,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw Korean movie for the first time and it was awesome. Everything in the movie was great from story to direction. If you are a movie lover you should not miss this one.</div>",Positive
385,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is actually 3 films in a suit pretending to be one big film and it does all those little films extremely well.</div>",Positive
386,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best foreign language films I've seen in a very long time. It's funny, sad, dark, clever, edge of your seat stuff. Its filmed &amp; acted beautifully &amp; the story is extremely entertaining. A must watch!</div>",Positive
387,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Superbly acted, brilliantly written and gorgeous to look at. Not faultless and a couple of cracks/gripes in the last act but overall a beautifully constructed film.
Nice to be kept thinking long afterwards and looking forward to seeing again.</div>",Positive
388,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's hard to explain for me... at first I think it's only comedy movie but at last, it showed me I was wrong. I said to myself I liked this movie..and also scared of it..
It was interesting movie of real life. This is my first Korea movie ,so I think it good.</div>",Positive
389,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The advance notice didn't have a spoiler at all. It's a long time since I saw such a movie that can arouse the audience's mood. The audience applauded several times in the middle of Cannes premiere. From laughter to horror to despair and grief, the director once again demonstrated his world's leading ability to integrate genre elements and social issues.</div>",Positive
390,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I used to think this movie is a tragedy but on a second watch I realised it's a  comedy. Clearly one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best thrillers of all time. The movie is very intelligent and very captivating. The pacing is very dynamic and the script is brilliant. The movie look beautifull, from production design to directing and cinematography everything was stunning. The set design express the social commentary about the difference between classes in very subtle and intelligent way. The ending was surprising in a good way.</div>",Positive
391,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In the year 2019, Parasite a
Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of
cinema.
The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie. I'll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more. The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra-ordinary. The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime. Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time, strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem. Hats off to Bong Joon-Ho &amp; Han Jin-won for creating this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
392,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A truly well deserved oscar winner🏆🎉🏆. This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen. The movie keeps you engaged and thrilled till the end. The director has extraordinary capabilities to have presented an ordinary plot into an overwhelming rollercoaster ride. A must watch for all the thriller folks out there.</div>",Positive
393,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now, what is there in the movie that gave it an Oscar? So the answer is its powerful but realistic concept. A difference that has spread among humans for centuries. I am rich you are poor, I will always be a master and you will always be a servant. Every time you watch the parasite, you will get a new perspective in the story. This is one of those films that you cannot understand very well at once. The ending of the movie has been cleverly presented so that every human can understand it with his thought. The direction of the movie is so vicious that you try to mind each of the senses of the movie, even then you will be forced to give up. The movie's original language is Korean, but despite this, people around the world are appreciating it.</div>",Positive
394,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a masterpiece movie. In the movie we see the difference classes in society and the behavior of the people of this society. One class people straggling for some food and other class has it even much than their need. Most of the thing of this movie we can compare with our real life. Really like this movie.</div>",Positive
395,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very much enjoyable, loveable and heart warming piece of art. But the end didn't match with the flavour of the movie and came to me as if a beautiful road trip has ended with a crash but still its a must watch.</div>",Positive
396,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Drama and exciting movie. The situation Turning situation, comedy</div>",Positive
397,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I first thought not to watch it but as soon as the story goes on we get mix with the characters . They are unbelievable , amazing , authentic , fantastic and funny .</div>",Positive
398,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Couldn't predict anything that would happen!! So good. Even when you don't want to watch you can't take your eyes off the screen
You might refrain yourself from watching it because it its in Korean, but looking back on it you don't even remember you read the entire story. Definitely worth it!!</div>",Positive
399,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched ""Parasite"" last night on a Netflix DVD, and I can now see why it won so many film industry awards! Wow -- it was wickedly funny and darkly disturbing at the same time. A unique plot with top-notch acting &amp; directing. I highly recommend it!!</div>",Positive
400,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Greed and class discrimination. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect.</div>",Positive
401,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Clever, darkly funny, original &amp; thoughtful movie about a destitute family who see an opportunity to exploit a rich one. Thoroughly recommend it. Little chance of Hollywood producing anything of this quality any more.</div>",Positive
402,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a suspenseful movie with some unexpected twists that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Watch and judge for yourself, I totally recomend it.</div>",Positive
403,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has to be the best movie I have ever seen. The performances of every actor and actress is absolutely amazing. The plot of the this film is amazing and the ending leaves it open to what could happen in the future. It is a great mixture of comedy and thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I found myself being sad that it was over when it was done. This will definitely not be a waste of your time and if you do not watch it you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.</div>",Positive
404,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon Ho (writer/director} is usually known for bashing the rich and powerful.. In this film he takes aim also at the poor who are depicted as conniving, immoral grifters. The Parks, the rich family who are the prey of the poor Kim family are shown as mostly naïve rather than cruel, The film is comedic for the first half and then takes a violent and serious turn. Riveting and thought provoke, highly recommended.</div>",Positive
405,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!</div>",Positive
406,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a phenomenal film with top notch acting and fantastic direction from Bong Joon-ho, known for the films Snowpiercer and The Host, this movie may be his masterpiece. It contains eccentric and interesting characters, as well as a bizzare plot line that should keep any audience thouroghly entertained throughout. I went in knowing nothing, and this is the best way to watch this movie. The less you know about the plot, the better. It won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and rightfully so, I'd say. The direction is flawless, many characters and subplots weave together to create a beautiful mess of a movie. I love this film, and anyone who loves movies will love it as well. The reason it doesn't recieve a 10 is due to its disjointedness, which seems intentional, though I would have preferred it to be more focused and feel less rushed. This film may have worked better if it was about 30 minutes longer. Anyway, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you haven't already, its sitting on Hulu right now.</div>",Positive
407,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie didn't disappoint! Everything felt original and it took a disturbing twist towards the end. The theme of the movie was clear from the get go! Overall great movie and I would watch again!</div>",Positive
408,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Clever and darkly humorous, 'Parasite' is Bong Joon-ho all the way through, and he gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast, the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor - those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve; how being one or the other defines who you are, and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that. Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director's bleak outlook doesn't affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is.</div>",Positive
409,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is the best film I have seen in a while. I am so glad that It has won numerous awards. No many films expose the inequality among social classes and climate change.</div>",Positive
410,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was sick (you know like good). I felt like I was waiting for everything to come crashing down at any moment, it was insane how much you wanted the family to succeed in their endeavors. They were lovable, even though their actions were meant to be revered you felt like you could relate to them. This movie definitely deserved the praise it received.
That ending tho.....</div>",Positive
411,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At first the idea of a poor family full of con artists going after an upper class family seemed kinda been there done that sort of. I wasn't really into this at the start. Once it got to the halfway part, it took a very unexpected turn and the suspense kicked in big time. I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill, getting bigger and bigger and then BAM! because that climax was crazy. I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit, besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. Good choice here.</div>",Positive
412,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying ""wow"".</div>",Positive
413,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the best foreign language films I've seen in a very long time. It's funny, sad, dark, clever, edge of your seat stuff. Its filmed &amp; acted beautifully &amp; the story is extremely entertaining. A must watch!</div>",Positive
414,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What and how and why and when that is the questions you gonna ask at the end</div>",Positive
415,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw Korean movie for the first time and it was awesome. Everything in the movie was great from story to direction. If you are a movie lover you should not miss this one.</div>",Positive
416,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is actually 3 films in a suit pretending to be one big film and it does all those little films extremely well.</div>",Positive
417,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.</div>",Positive
418,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. I dont consider myself worthy of reviewing a great master like him. Please watch if you can. One word. Wow!</div>",Positive
419,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended.</div>",Positive
420,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is so like realistic and entertaining,
I love the suspense and the acting is good and the story is so good.
It has a message to tell and the surprise is 50/50 kinda expected it but I like the overall movie.</div>",Positive
421,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's worthy of your time. No wonder its director won an Oscar, he did a great job. Also, you won't find a minute to be distracted or bored. One thing remains unsubtle, for me, I didn't get satisfied with the ending.</div>",Positive
422,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best movie of the year won the Academy Award for Best Picture and all of us.
Masterful direction from Bong,perfect ensemble cast but two hours...</div>",Positive
423,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. I dont consider myself worthy of reviewing a great master like him. Please watch if you can. One word. Wow!</div>",Positive
424,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way.

429,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Superbly acted, brilliantly written and gorgeous to look at. Not faultless and a couple of cracks/gripes in the last act but overall a beautifully constructed film.
Nice to be kept thinking long afterwards and looking forward to seeing again.</div>",Positive
430,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's hard to explain for me... at first I think it's only comedy movie but at last, it showed me I was wrong. I said to myself I liked this movie..and also scared of it..
It was interesting movie of real life. This is my first Korea movie ,so I think it good.</div>",Positive
431,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The advance notice didn't have a spoiler at all. It's a long time since I saw such a movie that can arouse the audience's mood. The audience applauded several times in the middle of Cannes premiere. From laughter to horror to despair and grief, the director once again demonstrated his world's leading ability to integrate genre elements and social issues.</div>",Positive
432,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I used to think this movie is a tragedy but on a second watch I realised it's a  comedy. Clearly one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best thrillers of all time. The movie is very intelligent and very captivating. The pacing is very dynamic and the script is brilliant. The movie look beautifull, from production design to directing and cinematography everything was stunning. The set design express the social commentary about the difference between classes in very subtle and intelligent way. The ending was surprising in a good way.</div>",Positive
433,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In the year 2019, Parasite a
Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of
cinema.
The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie. I'll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more. The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra-ordinary. The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime. Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time, strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem. Hats off to Bong Joon-Ho &amp; Han Jin-won for creating this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
434,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A truly well deserved oscar winner🏆🎉🏆. This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen. The movie keeps you engaged and thrilled till the end. The director has extraordinary capabilities to have presented an ordinary plot into an overwhelming rollercoaster ride. A must watch for all the thriller folks out there.</div>",Positive
435,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now, what is there in the movie that gave it an Oscar? So the answer is its powerful but realistic concept. A difference that has spread among humans for centuries. I am rich you are poor, I will always be a master and you will always be a servant. Every time you watch the parasite, you will get a new perspective in the story. This is one of those films that you cannot understand very well at once. The ending of the movie has been cleverly presented so that every human can understand it with his thought. The direction of the movie is so vicious that you try to mind each of the senses of the movie, even then you will be forced to give up. The movie's original language is Korean, but despite this, people around the world are appreciating it.</div>",Positive
436,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a masterpiece movie. In the movie we see the difference classes in society and the behavior of the people of this society. One class people straggling for some food and other class has it even much than their need. Most of the thing of this movie we can compare with our real life. Really like this movie.</div>",Positive
437,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very much enjoyable, loveable and heart warming piece of art. But the end didn't match with the flavour of the movie and came to me as if a beautiful road trip has ended with a crash but still its a must watch.</div>",Positive
438,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Drama and exciting movie. The situation Turning situation, comedy</div>",Positive
439,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I first thought not to watch it but as soon as the story goes on we get mix with the characters . They are unbelievable , amazing , authentic , fantastic and funny .</div>",Positive
440,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Couldn't predict anything that would happen!! So good. Even when you don't want to watch you can't take your eyes off the screen
You might refrain yourself from watching it because it its in Korean, but looking back on it you don't even remember you read the entire story. Definitely worth it!!</div>",Positive
441,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched ""Parasite"" last night on a Netflix DVD, and I can now see why it won so many film industry awards! Wow -- it was wickedly funny and darkly disturbing at the same time. A unique plot with top-notch acting &amp; directing. I highly recommend it!!</div>",Positive
442,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Greed and class discrimination. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect.</div>",Positive
443,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film's momentum transcends words however all I can say is ""Bong Joon-ho created a a masterpiece. Unspoken subtle truths overlayed by am immersive cinematic experience you will not forget. Definitely a must see if you tired of the same old movies.</div>",Positive
444,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The cinematic excellence of this film is one of a kind. It has such an original approach to its meaning and thought process for each scene. This film is one like no other. The fact that it has subtitles adds to the raw feeling and authenticity of the film. Giving each character a real element. It has so many genuinely intelligent plays, you have to watch it more than once to explore its excellence. The first time you watch it, you will be captured by the emotional and breathtaking journey it takes you on, and then the second time, you will be able to appreciate the brilliance of each mirrored scene, each tactical foreshadow and each hint that as a first time watcher you would be sure to miss. It has an outstanding, in-depth analysis and projection of the upper and lower class separations; each one of these being shown throughout and uniquely. Highly, highly recommended, I will keep this film as one of my greats for a long long time.</div>",Positive
445,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing more needs be said about this movie. If you haven't watched it yet, do so immediately.</div>",Positive
446,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The scenery, the performance, the achitecture, the cast, everything knits tightly together to form a bittersweet -masterpiece if I dare say- film. It's been a while since I saw it, but it stays with you; a must see for sure.</div>",Positive
447,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw it in black and white, the score is fantastic, and balanced horrifying topics with hilarious ones. A MASTERPIECE</div>",Positive
448,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Partly because i had to read the movie. No but seriously, wow, one of those movies that you just never want to end. So many things about this movie that is pleasing. From beginning to end, the movie is absolutely jam packed with stimulation. Deception, violence, unpredictability, bits of arousal, cultural reference, so much comedy, and an ending that definitely does not disappoint. From 1/8th in until the end, you'll just constantly be saying OMG. This movie was definitely deserving of best picture, perhaps even one of the best of the decade. I saw this about a week after I saw Joker, which was also amazing, and similarly disturbing. However, Parasite is just a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
449,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Interesting story within two levels of society poor and wealthy people,</div>",Positive
450,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Super entertaining and perfectly paced. Highly relatable and deeply moving. Near perfection.</div>",Positive
451,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing !! Mind blowing!!! If you haven't watched it yet, watch it right now</div>",Positive
452,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A best Korea movie . It's a masterpiece. Must watch movie 👀</div>",Positive
453,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this movie one week ago, was bored after 30 min and shut my pc down. Then my father and friends told me to give it a chance, I was like why not. I am so happy to listen to them, I have never seen a movie going from super boring to super thrilling and shocking. This movie well deserved an oscar. Avoid spoilers.</div>",Positive
454,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! I can't understand how or why this excellent film can be compared to ROMA. This is pure gold. Roma was bad in a lot of aspects, bad acting, bad rythm, history/screenplay, etc. Even using a great camera such as Alexa 65 was a great disappointment. Now, this film Parasite is in every area a superb film. We need more movies like this!!!</div>",Positive
455,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Truly one of the best movies I've seen so far. A first part which seems quite classic but intriguing, and then a memorable second part that makes us go through all the emotions. An instant classic.</div>",Positive
456,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best film I ever seen in my whole life. Masterpiece.</div>",Positive
457,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This isn't a feel-good movie. It is is the cold harsh reality of whatever the movie's message was. I was too grasped on the story itself to see the bigger picture. That could be the message itself. It really took my perspective of life and twisted it.</div>",Positive
458,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is great. The cinematography, the acting, the music, the writing, the directing, everything was great! The movie has some really funny scenes too.
This is a darkly comedic, shocking, masterpiece about rich and poor.</div>",Positive
459,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite thoroughly deserved the best picture Oscar and for once in a long time it's a winner that will be remembered as a classic. It's a master class in film making!<br/><br/>Don't read reviews or a synopsis, just watch the magnificence unfold before your eyes.</div>",Positive
460,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is, I didn't think it could possibly live up to all that praise.<br/><br/>Well, it somehow managed to be even better than I anticipated.
How the hell did Bong Joon-Ho manage that?!<br/><br/>This is an incredibly tense, darkly funny, beautifully shot and amazingly acted masterpiece and I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>From now on, I'm staying away from basements</div>",Positive
461,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watch this movie. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was happily suprised that I was watching a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
462,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing much to say. Absolutely amazing. The implicit examples of division between rich and poor were beyond imaginations.</div>",Positive
463,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Seen the Movie two times one in January and other recently in April. It really is a great movie although my mother hated it and was asking why it won the Oscar. I think this movie is a masterpiece as it all drama,comedy,terror,mistery it makes you go on an emotion rollercoaster , it makes you think about your life about desperation when you have nothing etc.. . Such a great movie that will perdure a long time.</div>",Positive
464,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie was do good unbelievable comedy , thriller, all in one package with good message..</div>",Positive
465,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie lives up to the hype. It's a work of art. Every single element is perfect. Must watch!!</div>",Positive
466,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With a masterful script and Bong Joon-Ho's (usual) brilliant direction, this film is easily one of the best of the year. The entire cast give amazing performances which keep you gripped and thats the main difference between this and Roma. I myself am not usually one for foreign films so if your first attempt at a foreign film was Roma and you found that a chore to sit through as I did, I urge you to watch Parasite. You won't be disappointed and the trailers do it absolutely no justice. Definitely a best director and best picture contender at the Oscars this year.</div>",Positive
467,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing.
I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here.
I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color.</div>",Positive
468,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a fantastic film made by the wonderful Bong Joon Ho. Every single frame is beautifully crafted and the story was investing throughout the entire two hour runtime. It is very darkly hilarious, smart, and overall excellent. It also has without a doubt one of the most realistic endings in film history. With a single flaw in sight, Parasite will be perfect for any movie-goer.</div>",Positive
469,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Holy crap. This is a tense movie. You really won't see the twist coming and even then you won't predict what happens. Funny, scary, sad, and yet weirdly sweet. Definitely deserved best picture. Insane.</div>",Positive
470,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In more years than I want to think about, I never would rate a movie a 10. However, this was impressive. From dark comedy, to violence, to reading everything (which is difficult because I'm not much of a reader) to dissecting each character, it blew my mind. I kept thinking about it days on end. I kept wondering what details I missed that I wanted to find again. This movie is for the creative mind. It isn't for those who just see black and white. From production to writing to music to directing, it was an incredible movie. I'm looking forward to waiting a year or so, so I can relive that magic again.</div>",Positive
471,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At the end of the film, the most desperate people, through this event, the son's life lessons are: make money, become rich.
However, the director's fable tells the audience that both are hell, and that this is a beautiful, cruel, funny and sad society.</div>",Positive
472,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It seems like a simple story,but really makes me think a lot.Human nature is complex,we can't understand it completely.</div>",Positive
473,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The whole process from ""sneaking into"" the rich family to ""parasitizing"" the upper class is full of a lot of cold humor processing and stage scheduling, exuding the charm of black comedy.</div>",Positive
474,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars.
Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place.
That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them.
Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'</div>",Positive
475,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is the best movie of the year, all scenes are amazing, and it has a very good message</div>",Positive
476,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To be short,this is a greatly directed,perfectly shot masterpiece with well-crafted characters that strike a balance between nastiness and sympathetic,and can be interpreted both ways;pitch dark humor that is both ironic and clever and fits the main theme,which perfectly blends horror with a satirical tone.</div>",Positive
477,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Having just rewatch the movie again last night, I'm again confirmed with why this title was my personal best movie of 2019. Even on second viewing, there isn't a single boring minute. The tale captures you from the very beginning and makes you feel heavily invested in the story right away.<br/><br/>The first hour is gleefully entertaining, showing the poor family put on a scam scheme. When you see it unfolds, it just leaves you with a smile on your face and laughing along with their execution. And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie. Not getting into spoilers, but this build up is well worth it.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is simply a viewing pleasure. Great acting, excellent story and cinematography filled with symbolism. An irreverent tale of class differences I would highly recommend anyone to give it a watch.</div>",Positive
478,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Decades have passed since we had such a masterpiece</div>",Positive
479,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's pretty obvious at this point, but this movie is brilliant. Food is a weapon. Smell is a weapon. What's in front of your window is a weapon. But so is karma, loyalty, and love. Parasite is a classic, with a story that will stand the test of time. It's also hilarious without seriously trying to be a comedy. This movie will last a while.</div>",Positive
480,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely lives up to the hype, so much better than I was expecting</div>",Positive
481,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No matter if you are rich, if you are poor. If you work or you are jobless. This movie will preserve deep in your heart for your whole life.<br/><br/>Take care of each other and don't cry about everything. No education needed, you just have to watch this film once in your lifetime.</div>",Positive
482,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. I loved the experience, I loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others. Parasite (Gisaengchung), for sure, is one of the best films I've ever seen.</div>",Positive
483,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will keep it short go see this film everyone. Totally deserves all its awards a masterpiece in film making by the director who gave us memories of murder. If you are a fan of Korean movies you will clearly love it and if you arent this may change your perception. It has it all comedy, drama, thriller you name it all merge beautifully.<br/><br/>ENOUGH SAID GO SEE IT NOW.</div>",Positive
484,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went to see Parasite in the cinemas... TWICE. This film is brilliant. It's funny in the most witty yet realistic way possible. It's deeply tragic. It's terrifying when you least expect it. Parasite leads you to believe that it's one thing, and suddenly transforms into another. It's a complete masterpiece. The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious. A repeat viewing is perhaps even more satisfying than the first, knowing what's THERE before it is revealed is just... a feeling I can't explain. It's a must watch. Not to be missed.</div>",Positive
485,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this film couple of months ago, so I'm not writing this review with a completely clear memory of everything that I loved about this movie. All I can say is that at least a week after watching it, I was still googling aaaaall the hidden meanings in certain scenes, all the interviews with the director, why they did some scenes in certain ways etc. This is how starstruck I was. Once I learned about all the layers, I could only conclude that this movie is a masterpiece! I had a class called ""Visual culture"" at my University and this movie would be perfect for the analysis of its visual language. And they show all the different relationships between rich and poor, happy and sad, right and wrong, in suuuuch a subtle way!! I really feel like people should write essays about this film.</div>",Positive
486,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was avoiding the movie for several months, because I wasn't sure how I feel about korean movies - I have a history with korean dramas and korean music, but the movies - there are a few, that I have seen and let's jut say that they weren't my cup of tea. But because of the nominations, I decided that I shoudn't skip the movie. And I am NOT sorry at all. Parasite is just a masterpiece and totally deserved to win the Oscar</div>",Positive
487,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is 100% AWESOME! I now understand all the hype...All the awards this movie has won is well deserved!!! Awesome...awesome...awesome film!!! Watch it you will not be sorry!!!</div>",Positive
488,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a brilliant film, I've been thinking about it all day and I saw it last night, I tried to think of any faults with this film, there are none! Funny, and suspenseful and edge of your seat! One of the best films I've ever seen!</div>",Positive
489,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an amazing, clever movie. It definitely deserves all of the awards it has gotten!</div>",Positive
490,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know plenty of people disliked this movie, and understandably so - but I mean every word I say when I claim that this is one of the best movies I've seen. For fans of darker storylines with twists throughout, those who don't mind sitting still for a few hours and reading subtitles to get completely immersed into a story, this movie is a wonderful way to do so.</div>",Positive
491,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am out of words. THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL! What a masterpiece. This made me laugh and shock with the series of happenings.</div>",Positive
492,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!<br/><br/>A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it.</div>",Positive
493,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I could not wait to see this film again as soon as I walked out of the theatre!<br/><br/>The film making is incredible, script writing is perfection! And the beautifully shot cinematography all blend together to create such a funny, sad and often tense story!</div>",Positive
494,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie itself is technically a masterpiece, its well written and it has good messages which arent hamfisted or overly 'pandery'</div>",Positive
495,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After seeing this I am not liking any other movie</div>",Positive
496,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Got hooked up on the movie since the first minute, the injustice, struggle and social inequality on its best. Great work</div>",Positive
497,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite combines multiple genres through a captivating story and interesting characters. The contrast in lifestyles between the Kims and the Parks is portrayed through the amazing camera work and the incredible set design.
The acting is simply jaw-dropping. I'm glad that these insanely talented korean actors are getting exposure through this film and I hope to see them on the big screen more often.
This movie is simply amazing. It's psychological, comedic, frighteningly real. I would highly recommend you watch it, but avoid spoilers, as they will ruin the surprises.</div>",Positive
498,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A masterly crafted movie with multiple layers of meaning. Full of enexpected twists and turns, packed with details and visually crafted in a masterly fashion.<br/><br/>It's hard to properly write a review without giving out spoilers but this movie truly deserves to be enjoyed unspoiled.</div>",Positive
499,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite, which combines elements of crime, comedy, suspense and social criticism, is almost perfect in the rhythm of the story. This paper attempts to analyze and interpret some of the problems in the film from different perspectives.</div>",Positive
500,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just couldn't expect to this. Brilliant and captivating. Deserves every damn prize</div>",Positive
501,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had me terrified the entire time which is incredibly rare. Easy 10. I've never experienced something like this.</div>",Positive
502,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was good. The cinematography is flawless, the script is well written, and the story is wildly original. Parasite is funny, incredibly original, gorgeous, and dark all at the same time.</div>",Positive
503,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An effective story, a wonderful show, began with comedy, but ended sadly.</div>",Positive
504,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is everything....i wish i could give more than 10</div>",Positive
505,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is just a pure masterpiece. You can see movies like this one only once in couple years. It was intense, interesting plot, amazing actors. Everyone was telling me like first half was OK, but second was boring so film is just Meh. How dare you? If you're basic person who loves only MARVEL or DC films of course this movie is not for you, but if you want to see something more deeper than that pick this one you won't regret. Totally recommended, my favourite movie of 2019.</div>",Positive
506,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie shows all the aspects of life.
Truth
Lie
Honesty
Karma
And destiny
Its a crux of life.
What a master piece</div>",Positive
507,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Family of cons get in deeper than they intended while trying to live a life they don't deserve. Unexpected twists and startling action, which does not deviate too far from possible reality.</div>",Positive
508,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best movie i like how the plot changes true masterpeice</div>",Positive
509,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story

My first exposure to korean cinema, off course after the wide International acclaim it received.
Everything aside this movie deserves evedy bit.
To take such a subject and majority of the movie shot in a house with such good acting
The director and the whole team stand out</div>",Positive
510,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly I was reluctant to watch this movie for a long time. Because I felt Joker should have cleaned up at the Oscars. But after seeing this I fully understand the academy's decision. What a masterpiece of storytelling. It simply has every ingredient a perfect movie needs. Excitement, laughter and crying it's all in there.</div>",Positive
511,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant screenplay Strory telling
Director had done his job very very.... Awesomely
Actors act brilliant
Excellent story and concept

512,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Again, flawless, mind boggling and genius, I'm out of words</div>",Positive
513,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Excellent movie, must see period
Story, acting, everything was perfect.</div>",Positive
514,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite was my favorite film from 2019. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The conflict escalates to a boiling point at the end that left me in total shock. A true masterpiece.</div>",Positive
515,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well deserved best movie of the year!You have to watch it untill someone thinks to copy it! It's brilliant!
Normally i stay away from foreign movies but this one changed my mind,also i do not write reviews this one deserves it!</div>",Positive
516,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply put it deserved all the praise it got, and the movie is a masterpiece. One of Bong's best movies to date. Will become cult classic in a few years.</div>",Positive
517,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I hear the words ""A Korean film about class conflict"" I think it's gonna be something stupidly pretentious and needlessly experimental. But no, this film is a masterclass in direction, acting, suspense, camerawork, beautiful scenery, and even comedy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film. I did feel the peach thing was a bit stupid and it's dumb that it was a huge plot-point. Bravo Bong Joon Ho. 9.4/10</div>",Positive
518,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is where the class dystopia begins, we see a story that looks as if it is false or to good to be true but it is! This movie seems to take on so many things and balance them all with perfection and grace. hats off to Boon Joon Ho for is fantastic wrtting and revolutionary direction.</div>",Positive
519,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I couldn't help but laugh at the gullible rich family when the poor underdogs manipulated them and got jobs in their house. The second half is a great thriller. The movie has many twists that will leave you baffled. I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a must watch .</div>",Positive
520,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No spoilers in this review.
I hope that every film buff sees this wonderful piece of art. Not often does a filmmaker pull off this amount of creativity. Bravo!</div>",Positive
521,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Paracite is a suitable title fir this movie. Watch this movie. It has everything.</div>",Positive
522,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am not someone who gives high high ratings. Seeing this film I now understand the awards it has one. This story transcends all cultures in all countries. The haves and the have nots. It exemplifies that it does not matter in the full realm how life ends up. The acting was superb and watching it in the original language made it so more realistic.</div>",Positive
523,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is must watch.What goes around comes around.</div>",Positive
524,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No words.... wow, what a movie. Loved it. This is my kind of film. I even clapped at the credits. Nothing else to say except its a magnificent watch and a great critique on capitalism and why we need to end it. Loved this so much... *top 10 favorite</div>",Positive
525,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie left me with a very sad feeling :( Ut was heartbreaking to watch the poverty these people are exposed to. Weird, but amazing and sad movie. I cant give much more details then this. Just see the movie for yourselves.</div>",Positive
526,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was immensely fun to watch! My wife and I heard a lot of buzz around this so we decided to give it a watch for ourselves. Acting was a 10/10 with a unique story that was executed 10/10 with fantastic cinematography and directing 10/10. I can't say enough about this movie, it's a MUST WATCH. On a side note going into the movie me and the wife watched the trailer but didn't get much out of it, GOOD! The less you know going into this, the more you will enjoy it!</div>",Positive
527,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its a great movie. It has a dark humor vibe than takes a sarl turn and becomes a horror/thriller movie and I love it.</div>",Positive
528,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I feel like I could turn off the sound on my TV and just watch everything visually unfold. Everything from the camera's perspective is just beautiful.</div>",Positive
529,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! Parasite is a great ride!!<br/><br/>Although there was some grimness, it's not a horror flick, but a psychological thriller. The film paints with grandiose broad strokes using extravagance to tell a bigger story...a story about social inequality and the gullibility of people, particularly entitled acting rich foks. The story crawls into your mind and leaves you pondering.<br/><br/>PS. Can I just say that I'm sickened by the fact that the rich husband &amp; wife have matching pajamas 🙄<br/><br/>*Disclaimer: if anyone has matching pajamas with their significant other, my apologies 😆</div>",Positive
530,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Are u kidding me. im speechless. idk have anything left to say. pls imbd let me post this.</div>",Positive
531,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Execution ✅

To win best picture (f*$@ yes )✅</div>",Positive
532,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was surprised that it was so much fun. The entertainment, the artistry, and the social grasp were also the best. It is an oversized home run of a giant stadium that the greatest genius of this era struck.</div>",Positive

534,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Incredible twist that leaves you in disbelief. Must watch</div>",Positive
535,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a weird movie but intriguing. It kept my interest and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</div>",Positive
536,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With every genre this movie steps it's foot in, it knocks the performance out of the park. Whether it be comedy, horror, thriller, you name it, this film delivers. Films of this nature can oftentimes be predictable, leaving the resulting action to feel, dull. This film will have you on the edge of your seat for more than half of its duration, and leave you shocked at the end.</div>",Positive
537,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite came along just when I thought I'd seen the best 2019 had to offer. The movie progressed elegantly like an amazing musical composition hitting every note rhythmically.<br/><br/>The depth of the characters and the story kept me glued to my seat begging the credits don't roll, all the while thinking this is what cinema should be. And when the credits did roll, I stared at the black screen in a moment of contemplation and silence for this piece of art. Absolutely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. 10/10</div>",Positive
538,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I knew nothing about this film until I watched it. Thank god I watch no trailers or even read a description of it. I didn't even know the plot and that made it so much more exciting. Its split into two movies. Exactly halfway the movie a doorbell rings and it changes to the second movie. I was gripped from start to end. Anyone who gave it a 1 star just hasn't seen the movie.
Probably one of the greatest movies of all time!</div>",Positive
539,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What more is there to say? I never rate movies a 10/10 but this is an 11. It's just amazing, there isn't a single thing about it i didn't love. This is my favorite movie, hands down.</div>",Positive
540,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A true masterpiece, left me feel-after a really long time-that I had watched a wholesome movie with an original theme. I found everything perfect-The cinematography, cast, music, picture, constant twists in plot that stirred up all different kinds of feelings -everything!
I definitely recommend to watch even just for the sake of watching something non hollywood style!!</div>",Positive
541,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Was a very thrilling movie. Loved the graphics and mood.</div>",Positive
542,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is essentially the perfect film as it does everything - storytelling, visuals, sound, editing, acting etc. - to perfection.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" belongs in the discussion of the greatest films of all-time in my opinion and everyone who appreciates a good film should certainly watch this one.<br/><br/>10/10</div>",Positive

544,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is not for everyone, as it is a totally unique style of film and story. In my opinion though, it is done to perfection. I love how it is a bit of everything: a horror, thriller, comedy, romance, crime, etc.<br/><br/>I honestly think it's best to just go in not knowing what to expect, and you'll be taken on a wild and fun ride.</div>",Positive
545,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was lost in words after watching this movie. You really can't describe this movie except for the word ""perfect"". Just go watch it and you'll understand.</div>",Positive
546,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a true masterpiece. Outstanding! May be the best movie of the decade. Amazing story, amazing screenplay,outstanding cinematography, beautiful music or sound, super acting. Overall it is one of best in history. And Bong Joon-ho is a legend.</div>",Positive
547,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very good all up. Loved all the high graphics and soundtrack that went with it. Would see this movie again. Overall very good a solid 10/10</div>",Positive
548,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In an age of extreme CGI and remakes, Parasite was a treat to watch. The storyline is one of the best I have seen so far. The movie starts of with the viewer thinking it would go one way and then it takes an abrupt turn in the best way possible. I was blown away by the subtle meanings of some of the scenes and dialogues and did not even realize their importance until after a day of finishing the movie. The more time you spend thinking about the screenwriting and direction, the more you start to understand what a masterpiece this is. one hundred percent must watch.</div>",Positive
549,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Every two minutes, the scene changes so you don't get bored.</div>",Positive
550,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just finished this movie. This whole movie give an amazing experience. The story is beyond our imagination. The performance of the all cast is just outstanding. It's a must watch for all movie lovers.</div>",Positive
551,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This one made a stunning impact for sure! It is not overrated. Highly recommended. 😊</div>",Positive
552,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was so excited to see this movie after all the awards it got and my expectations were high, but it somehow managed to exceed all those expectations. it's simply brilliant and honestly one of the best movies i've ever seen!</div>",Positive
553,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I liked parasite.<br/><br/>It was... at least a movie. As someone who watched Parasite.
Watch it if you enjoy movies, as it is one.
With a run time of two hours, it is longer than any movie over two hours.
The characters ran at multiple points throughout the film, it made me think about running; very scary.
If you are a fan of morse code, this movie is for you. With some really representation for morse and braille speakers.
I rate this movie.<br/><br/>As someone who had a parasite, I feel like this does my strife justice.<br/><br/>10 Clapping Emoji's out of 10.</div>",Positive
554,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A well crafted film that does not confine itself to a genre. Equal parts thriller, drama, comedy, and suspense. While it is a scathing indictment on classism, it does an amazing job of condemning the institution and not necessarily the individual. It is in identifying with characters that Joon-ho really exposes the psychological hold economic class has on the individual and society. The pacing is brilliant, always engaging and playing with tempo nicely. Loved it.</div>",Positive
555,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie deserves every bit of attention it has got. Parasite is a surreal experience of luxury, scheming, and deception. I can not wait to see what Bong Joon-Ho has for us next.</div>",Positive
556,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing storyline with truth and depiction of difference between two class of our social stigma.</div>",Positive
557,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This story is incredible- beautiful cinematography and excellent directing. The characters and relationships are dynamic and you can't look away. Not surprised that this won the Oscar for Best Film</div>",Positive
558,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">From its foreign dialogue to its perfect cinematography, this movie will keep you glued to your screen. I saw this movie not knowing anything at all about it, with no expectations, and yet it has been one of the best films I have seen. This film takes any genre you can think of to its maximum: drama, suspense, horror, action, vengeance, happiness, sadness, and many more. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is simply just that good. Hands down the best movie of 2019.</div>",Positive
559,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting and writing is just excellent. There is never a dull moment in the movie. It is one of those movies where you never have to look at the watch to see how much time has passed by. The class struggle is brought out in a humorous way that is dark and disturbing at the same time. The characters seem very real and remain fresh in memory long after the movie is over. A must watch Korean film.</div>",Positive
560,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've had my eye on this movie for quite a while, because I have to talk myself into watching movies with subtitles. I'm am extremely grateful that I did. I now understand the multiple reasons this movie garnered it's acclaim. Name a genre and this movie covers it. If you haven't seen it, do it.</div>",Positive
561,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I've seen in year's. Thank God</div>",Positive
562,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is just different from other movies that I have watched &amp; it's reality based too.
Its just awesome how they unfold the mysteries and I'll surely say that you'll not get bored watching this movie.<br/><br/>It has a mixture of different feelings and the musics that were choosen is just perfectly matched.Besides the actors also done great job in acting.<br/><br/>To be honest,the ending was kinda unexpected and surprising to me but in conclusion i have to say that it has done a perfect ending though.
Overall its a great movie too watch for everyone because it I'll give you thrill,romance,crime, mystery, comedy and even horror vibes too.</div>",Positive
563,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I'm not finished with the film as I right this, this film is a social study of the wealthy and the destitute. A poor family systematically infiltrates a wealthy family, essentially taking over the house in a sense. I have a feeling that this won't end well.</div>",Positive
564,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought this film didn't deserve the tow best film in oscar but I was wrong</div>",Positive
565,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is an awesome roller coaster ride which you dont want to stop even after the movie ends you want more and more. Perfact combination of stars awesome story something new each and every scene sticks you like a glue. And you got hangover of this movie for days.</div>",Positive
566,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.
Never expected, from the cast to director.
I forced my friends to watch and everybody agreed with me.</div>",Positive
567,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">PARASITE is that rare movie that works for both cinephiles and an audience seeking nothing more than an entertaining two hours. For me, this is the best sort of movie, giving the audience both food for thought and a great time. Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal.</div>",Positive
568,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Love this story, characters, humor. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's no question tags, doubts. When you are thinking that everything what could happen just happened something new appears.</div>",Positive
569,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't review movies on IMDB but when I do they are mostly for the exceptional ones in my opinion. That said, there is a notion that Oscar winning movies are overhyped and though I feel there's some truth to that....this movie is an outlier! This movie deserved the ""Best Picture"" award.<br/><br/>On a side note, name a genre and this movie covers it comedy, thriller, drama, dark comedy, empathy. Hats off to the actors, producers and the director!</div>",Positive
570,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I have seen so far. It is intuitive, funny and keep you watching with fascination. The best is that you can't predict the course of the movie and it continues to surprise throughout. I can highly recommend anyone to watch this movie.</div>",Positive
571,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies of 2019! A powerful, incredible and emotional picture.</div>",Positive
572,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best movie I've ever seen. The story is dark but the meanings are deep. The most of the scene was memorable.</div>",Positive
573,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you haven't seen this because of the subtitles, get over that quickly because you're missing out on not only this film but thousands of others. Parasite tackles capitalism and classism in present day South Korea. Visually, it is amazing. Plot-wise, it is phenomenal. There are tons of metaphors and twists that make this movie so wonderful.</div>",Positive
574,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of his best works. Builds unlike many movies and comes to an end in fantastic fashion. A must watch and hooks you to the point that you don't even realize you are reading subtitles.</div>",Positive
575,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Lovely movie.but last part of the movie is just shoking.i felt like.. Wow..awesome</div>",Positive
576,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dark and humorous with an unexpected turn of events.<br/><br/>I think one of the best things about Parasite is that for a foreign film it doesn't feel like a foreign film. At least in my experience foreign films always felt somewhat polarizing like either you watched them or you didn't and I feel like this movie is a good starting point. It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn't expect it to be that way.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching.</div>",Positive
577,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An original movie about class ""fight"" in today's society. Bong Joon Ho never fails when he writes and directs, and i think this is his masterpiece until now. A real gem of cinematography, writing, edit and everything, really. The number of genres i've seen in this film is ridiculous, but at the same time, they're all consistent together thanks to the ability of the people that worked behind this. I also recommend this movie to who has never seen a korean/non english movie!</div>",Positive
578,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie would keep you on your toes. A must watch if you want a movie from which you can extract knowledge. Use of symbols elevates this movie (get it. Elevates? You will get it after you see it)</div>",Positive
579,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a remarkable film of the century which depicts many social issues we confront everyday such as class system, racism, global warming, gap between the rich and the poor and discrimination against poverty along many other social issues that we face everyday. Director Bong Joon-Ho has dealt with various topics as such in his previous films yet this film has the best story telling and cinematography as seen. This film deserves global attention not just for film lovers but for all in which we can all relate one way or another to criticise what needs attention and correction in our society. Recommend to all genre of movie lovers as this has hints of humour, comedy, action as well as drama.</div>",Positive
580,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've never watched a movie like this one. It's a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
581,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's 0 comedy from start to finish, I don't know why the tag is there.<br/><br/>Good job imdb.</div>",Positive
582,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Cinematic Masterpiece with a mixed genre. A film that will hold you up and never bore you not even for a second. Its storyline, drastic drama which leaps up the story. Its an tecnical masterpiece cause Boon jong ho knows what he is doing and he crafted it well.
If you asked is it the movie of the decade?
Well, i can't tell it but it will be in the list.
Haooy watch.</div>",Positive
583,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Literally so many unexpected twists and non-cliché<br/><br/>Literally I can watch this movie every single day without getting bored</div>",Positive
584,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw Joker, The Irishman, Ford V Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit and Once upon a time in Hollywood but i 100% agree with this movie winning the Oscar.
Well done !</div>",Positive
585,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Throughly enjoyable throughout, big anime fan so the subtitles were no issue.</div>",Positive
586,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is Brilliant! I loved it. The portrayal of class struggles, the twists and the tense moments...amazing. This film was brilliantly executed! It is a masterpiece. If you havent seen it yet, dont wait.</div>",Positive
587,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is so much better to dive into this knowing nothing. I only watched the trailer prior to the movie and it shocked me after. Everything is stitched to perfection. Great commentary on society.</div>",Positive
588,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema.</div>",Positive
589,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't write long reviews, and I'm not going to here. All you need to know is that this film is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Acting was superb, directing was world-class, plot was near perfect. Seriously, go watch this movie right now.</div>",Positive
590,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was wondering about whether or not to watch this movie. Not a fan of Asian movies ... but I started watching it and within 2 minutes I was completely fascinated with it !! the purest Tarantino &amp; Almodovar style... cast, script, dialogues, etc... you don't know if laugh or cry !!</div>",Positive
591,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Surprisingly easy to watch. It's a film on many levels starting as a gentle comedy, morphing into something a lot more macabre. Seeks to provide commentary on social class in Korea as well as a nod to the political environment of having a non friendly neighbour in the North. The title is brilliant</div>",Positive
592,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow! This one really blew me away! The writing is just too good for words to describe. Each and every aspect of film making whether direction , acting , editing , production design, sound design etc. is just best it can get . When you see this movie you will go "" oh this deserves an Oscar"". And you got it right , it actually won the Oscar's. Too many reasons for it to win the Oscar's.
The writer and director Bong Joon Ho simply deserves a standing ovation and then in true Korean style, a big bow down with folded hands!</div>",Positive
593,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Snowpiercer"" is certainly the most competent Marxist allegory I've yet seen, so I looked forward to ""Parasite"" as a more ground-level discussion of how vast wealth warps society and leads to dire results.
It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: ""trickle down"".
""Trickle down"" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom.
Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen.
There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with.
But they're not happy, and anyone who believes ""trickle down"" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision?
A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see.</div>",Positive
594,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It has been a longtime since I've had a viewing experience so unique for an initial watch and even more unique for the rewatch. There is so much to appreciate about this film on a surface level and even more the deeper you look into it. Simply put amazing. This film is best to see when you don't know too much about the plot.</div>",Positive
595,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For the first time in history, a movie which actually deserved an Oscar, received an Oscar!</div>",Positive
596,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale.</div>",Positive
597,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie show's that you don't need a lot of money to create a good movie just talent needed the best movie of the 2019 absolutely just watch it if my review doesn't convince you mabye 4 oscars awards can</div>",Positive
598,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved the story n all casting. Beautiful pictures. Well descrption of social classes and change on human mind</div>",Positive
599,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite was awesome. From the screenwriting to the acting, this was a film. This was a beautiful film. From the twist and turns it makes, to the surprise ending. Parasite had it all. I wish I was able to have seen it sooner but no theaters near me were playing it. But it's ok because I watched it and loved every second of it. The world this movie brings together, between wealthy and poor. This was a beautifully shot film and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I don't want to talk too much about the film because I don't want to spoil it, so please. Go see Parasite, you will not regret it.</div>",Positive
600,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watch it. It has everything; entertainment, comedy, thrill, horror (yes!), suspense, drama, tragedy everything!!
Movie has several messages, several anecdotes, things shown metaphorically.</div>",Positive
601,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a masterpiece. From it's funny, engaging opening, to it's shocking, sudden end has beautiful cinematography and great hidden meanings throughout the movie. I need say no more.
9.9/10</div>",Positive
602,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films I've ever seen. Amazing. If you've not seen it yet, stop reading this and go watch it.</div>",Positive
603,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really good movie, the story line of the movie was incredible and it floated piece by piece as well.</div>",Positive
604,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?<br/><br/>This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?<br/><br/>It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal.
It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer.
It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.<br/><br/>Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it.</div>",Positive
605,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an awesome movie plot! Really enjoyed this movie</div>",Positive
606,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the most powerful things about this film is that at first sight, it seems that the evil of the poor is naked, while the rich family is a little innocent. But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family. The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society.</div>",Positive
607,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A superb movie with a great and interesting plot. Acting feels natural and all characters are well written. Cinematography is beautiful and the symbolism in stairs and different levels is clever. The only little downside is the slow progress at the start. But that doesn't matter because the movie a masterpiece and everyone should see it. I'm looking forward to seeing more from Bong Joon Ho.</div>",Positive
608,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am one of those people who watched this movie only after it won the Oscar. And one thing about giving in to any kind of hype is that it mostly doesn't live up to it. But boy, Parasite blew me away and how.<br/><br/>The point the maker is trying to make will definitely hit anyone who watches it. Humor is used beautifully. The climax is mindblowing. This movie comes closest to being absolutely perfect.</div>",Positive
609,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fun and exciting movie
Junho Bong is the one of the popular man in korea
I totally trust his movie is always fun</div>",Positive
610,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a film for film fans, who wants to see something interesting, new, brilleant, with oh my god feeling
This is bloddy brilleant film
Super direction, acting, and the production design</div>",Positive
611,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has got to be the best original movie I have seen, and it is definitely in my top 5 movies of all time.
I don't want to summarize the movie now, I am lazy, but I highly recommend this masterpiece and you should definitely watch it without me giving away anything.</div>",Positive
612,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had me speechless.
it literally covers all the genres and the message behind is a thing we should all consider once again.
the actors, the catchiness, THE SCENARIO. it's an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>y'all should watch this movie
and when you're done, watch it again..</div>",Positive
613,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres, making it a masterpiece. Being a non-English film winning an Oscar sure explains it. This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes, especially portraying the rage of the lower class.<br/><br/>Other than those, the cinematography, lighting, foreshadowing of events, the plot were outstanding. This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad.. Won't give out any spoilers, this is a must watch film for anyone! This will probably go down in history as one of the best movies of all time.</div>",Positive
614,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely one of the best movies you can watch from 2019</div>",Positive
615,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.<br/><br/>A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.<br/><br/>You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.</div>",Positive
616,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the things<br/><br/>Very intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)</div>",Positive
617,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never seen a movie like this before. It was brilliant.</div>",Positive
618,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A fantastic dark comedy with unpredictable twists and turns.</div>",Positive
619,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Objective as i could get, this one really had everything right for me. i even watched it at the right time even if it was too late but i think it was worth it. i loved every frame of it and it delivered its message in the best way it could. dark comedy is one of my favorite genres and this further solidified it's position and worth in my opinion. i'm not a movie critic, i enjoy them. everyone in its own. so i really don't have the dictionary or the knowledge to throw big words, all i have is my feelings and they were obvious. thank you bong joon-ho for the experience. it was the best i've had in a long time.</div>",Positive
620,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A combination of intense drama and dark comedy. Will definitely keep you entertained trough out the movie.</div>",Positive
621,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's describing our society these days. You can enjoy it and giving you a new perspective about how lifes in world works. The plot was spectacular with some twist, giving you a stage of excitement about what will happen in the next second.</div>",Positive
622,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best flim i have ever seen.Truly recommended to see the flim everyon.</div>",Positive
623,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie, or anyone I wouldn't want to show this movie.<br/><br/>(Okay but the soundtrack is really good though. Like really good. Like really really really good. Like re</div>",Positive
624,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been thinking, how do you avoid tragedy? It's better if they don't open the door, or go to the police, than if they do. Because to avoid the real owner of the house to get things must be ""shady"".<br/><br/>But then again, maybe it was in the moment of alcohol-induced happiness that I really thought I was rich and had a kind heart that shouldn't belong to me.</div>",Positive
625,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This one is a masterpiece. It will make you laugh sometimes, it will chill you sometimes, and it will make you cry sometimes. This movie will be with to the end</div>",Positive
626,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everything here is perfect. From the characters, plot, theme, music, jokes, cinematography and all.</div>",Positive
627,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon Ho has made incredible movies in his movie career, but this is without a doubt his best, as well as the best movie released in 2019, and also one of the best movies of the decade. Playing masterfully between different genres, Parasite is surprisingly one of the most universal movie of the century. I know that subtitles can be new to some, but the worth of this movie can´t be tamed by subtitles.</div>",Positive
628,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely flawless a simple example of a perfect film
The kid was drawing the picture of the the man in the bunker</div>",Positive
629,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Racists can stay pressed. Best movie of all time and deserved even more Oscars.</div>",Positive
630,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An extraordinary film and a rarity to see a film which is so startlingly original. I can't wait to see more of this director's work.</div>",Positive
631,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Worth multiple rewatches<br/><br/>Love the multiple reviews on the beatiful cinematography, directing and editting.<br/><br/>Should have won more categories at the Oscars</div>",Positive
632,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I forgot I was watching a Korean movie. Was too captivated by everything that happened in the movie. Pitiful, comical, thrilling and horrifying. It's not simple to understand though. One can interpret in many ways.
Anyone shud watch it in a lifetime.</div>",Positive
633,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've never seen a film build up, so artfully, the desire in its audience to see a rich person get killed just for being rich. So well done. The twists and turns, the comedy, the horror. Flawlessly crafted film.</div>",Positive
634,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Third rewatch later. Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted. A slow-paced thriller that keeps you on edge, whilst never quite becoming sinister, just powerfully developing the characters' stories to the ultimate conclusion. Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.<br/><br/><ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul></div>",Positive
635,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had no expectations before watching Parasite, it's truly one of the best films of 2019. My love and affection for this film is just like every other great movies I've watched.
The film also takes a dig at meritocracy, the humor in the film is quite outstanding. Kang-Ho Song has played his played his character with near perfection and the narration is just as good. All in all this is just a masterpiece!</div>",Positive
636,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A great movie with outclass direction,Script,Story,Acting,Music all was too good,even before this movie south korea produce many masterpiece but we surprised win first time Cannes Prestigious ( Palm Di""or Award ,France) BAFTA( UK) Australian Academy award,Golden Globe , Screen Actor guild award &amp; Oscar award etc this the only movie was in Oscar(2020) was tottaly deserve to win Best direction,Best movie,Best orignal script award</div>",Positive
637,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is such a brilliant movie I have ever seen! I am in complete awe after watching this movie, definitely an Oscar winning movie. The story-line and acting both were good, director maintained a prefect control to the story throughout. It has comedy, drama and thriller as well.</div>",Positive
638,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe how good Parasite was. All three acts of the movie were so weirdly great. Hilarious throughout and somehow tense, I love both of the family's characters, and the ending was perfect.</div>",Positive
639,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love korean movies very much, but this, this is the first time i review a movie, because i really like it, and i heard Parasite won the oscar 2019 woow</div>",Positive
640,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I cant even understand how good this movie is, my mind is too small to truly acknowledge the very masterpiece i have just saw 10 minutes ago.</div>",Positive
641,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a great story about social differences which will leave you amazed by its photographic qualities, the performances by the actors, and the plot!<br/><br/>I adore the way this movie is able to tell the story without being so stereotypically in-your-face about who is the bad guy and who is the good one.<br/><br/>If you like Lars von Trier and Stanley Kubrick, I think you will love this movie.</div>",Positive
642,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The scene where the family was under the table was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever watched in a movie. 10/10 amazing movie, those reviewing it anything lower then a 7 don't know what a good movie is.</div>",Positive
643,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finishing this movie left me in AWE. Everything from the transition from a lighthearted introduction to a thriller drama, the directing, the intricate storyline (notice how connected everything is - really shows great scriptwriting), the reversal of roles and even the lumming existence of reality...I could go on for HOURS. To keep a long story short, this movie was SPECTACULAR. Do not shy away from this movie. The Academy has done something right.</div>",Positive
644,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Won best picture, I understood why after watching it. Definitely a must watch.</div>",Positive
645,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved it. LOVED LOVED loved it.
Wow just wow. Everything in this movie is just so damn captivating. Parasite was directed Bong Joon Ho and man....you sir...take a god damn bow. This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917. This along with my top 10 list is the best movies of all time. 10/10 Brilliant absolutely brilliant</div>",Positive
646,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-ho is a genius, and this movie is a masterpiece. That's it!</div>",Positive
647,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Literally, the best movie of the decade. And no, i'm not exaggerating. It has everything, korean cinematography did it again! Congratulations to them, they deserve.</div>",Positive
648,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie. I was laughing almost the whole time and when I wasn't, I was holding my hand over my mouth with surprise. Every twist and turn of the story is paced and delivered. Every character is spot on.<br/><br/>I love a film with a message, and this one is loud and clear.<br/><br/>You should watch it. I don't care that it's in Korean, you should watch it.</div>",Positive
649,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved this Film from Start to End! The Parks n Kim's playing the role of Rich &amp; Poor perfectly. Great Cast! Loved the role of up and down shots n those stairs!!! Best Film of 2019 easily</div>",Positive
650,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Your intrest, your excitement builds in every scene. One of the best screenplay. This was my first Korean movie to watch and it stole me.</div>",Positive
651,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies of all time!
Screenplay and directing are amazing. Acting is superb</div>",Positive
652,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fantastic movie, I really liked it. History, script, actors, it was really a very good work.</div>",Positive
653,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I was echanted with every twist and turn this movie presented. The pacing and shifts in the storyline melded together beautifully to create a captivating film. This movie is an instant classic that I could watch again and again. Wonderful and fun movie!</div>",Positive
654,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">WOW<br/><br/>If you see this one movie this year, make sure it's Parasite.<br/><br/>I will remember this movie for a long time. So funny yet so dark towards the end of this excellent film. Bong Joon Ho deserves every award he has one for this absolute gem. Please see this movie!</div>",Positive
655,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, I'll make it short and sweet. A must watch! Paradise is the best movie i've seen in a long time. Thank you for making this.</div>",Positive
656,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is an amazing watch! I didn't really know what to expect going watching this and the end product most certainly didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the soundtrack is magnificent and the acting is insane. I really liked how much effort they took to make the scenes beautiful. The starting scene looked beautiful and the intense scenes actually felt intense.<br/><br/>The Parasite's storyline was just so bizarre and fun. I was thrilled the whole time to see where the movie was going. Especially the ending felt really well-executed.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie was phenomenal! If, this review sparked interest in you id definitely recommend giving this movie a shot.</div>",Positive
657,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-ho delivers an engaging film that continues to get more engaging by the minute and lives up to and exceeds it's hype. The story goes from funny to thrilling to dark in the 132 minutes of a genius plot.</div>",Positive
658,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's hard to pinpoint what's so great about this movie. Just watch it.</div>",Positive
659,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Aside from the film's encapsulating theme of socio-economic disparity, Bong Joon-ho achieves a Hitchcock-like presence that will have you at the edge of your seat. Suspense, comedy, and drama fall short in describing the intersectional and multimodal genre of this on-screen Román a clef. Setting the tone for the 2020's, Parasite is internationally relatable, aesthetically pleasing, and witty - ""we all have a crazy family"" comes to life as more than just a phrase in this two-hour phenomenon of the decade.</div>",Positive
660,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wish I could give a thousand stars. This is a masterpiece and a love letter to cinema.</div>",Positive
661,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">-Comedy
-Drama
-Thriller
-Horror<br/><br/>Parasite is all that! an amazing movie about how you can work all your life and be miserable. Yeah, they are some mistakes, but it's a movie after all, so enjoy it!</div>",Positive
662,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't even know what to say. In fact, I don't even want to say anything about this movie. Just go see it if you haven't. You'll be glad you did.</div>",Positive
663,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of best crime/thriller i've watched. I can't guess where the plot will bring me, every minute in the movie i tried to guess but mostly i wrong, and got the unexpected, even the ending. Every character really has strong impact in the movie, and you must pay attention about every little detail they do, because that builds up the story, and has really deep meaning for the story. The movie itself is masterpiece, really worth watching.</div>",Positive
664,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a perfect mirage of spoiled and discriminated minds and society we are living in.</div>",Positive
665,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the first movie that can take me places, from comedy to drama to romance to action to thriller to horror to all the combination that grips me speechless at the end of it. I watched it three times and it feels as great every time. Camera works are very structured, scenes are orchestrated almost mathematically they fill my heart so right. Acting is evenly of quality, no one outshines anyone else. Superb!</div>",Positive
666,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I normally do not watch subtitle movies yet the reviews, awards, and comments from friends had me curious. I am thrilled I saw it. Not sure what to make of it. Acting and photography was grand. I know I will watch it again. I missed parts of the subtitles because they went by too fast. I got the gist so I allowed it to play through. Rented it through Apple TV, watched it in the comfort of our home 😎</div>",Positive
667,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was freaking amazing!! On top of the genius commentary on class in developed countries and all the nuances it uses in that story, it is absolutely gorgeous. Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone.</div>",Positive
668,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Hi At first glance at the movie It looks simple But I sink deep into the film Throughout the film, one looks at the power of thinking and the power of man himself But wealth is everything And poverty incapacity Thanks</div>",Positive
669,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) is directed and written by Bong Joon Ho. It is a thriller that tells the story of a poor, Lower class family that slowly worm their way into the household of a rich, upper class family. One by one the family get hired to do a job, with the employers unaware that they are a family. Things take an unexpected turn in the third act and I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the way that this movie ended up. I really enjoyed Parasite and in my opinion, it deserves the Academy Awards that it won.</div>",Positive
670,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is full of symbolism that gives it amazing rewatchability. It meshes heist, humor, and horror genres incredibly well all while delivering important social commentary.</div>",Positive
671,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very suspense and dark humour are glamorously seen. Acting are superb. What a masterpiece. Well deserved Oscar 👍</div>",Positive
672,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie holds the pure depth of cinematic drama in 02 hours</div>",Positive
673,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have never rated a film 10/10 (apart from Studio Ghibli's My Neighbor Totoro) because I simply cannot find a film worthy of such score (apart from Totoro) however, I think I've found my perfect film.
We went in blind, only taking what we had seen from the trailer and read about during the awards season. So we didn't have any expectations other than, it must have been pretty good to win several Oscars - which in my opinion doesn't mean shiiiiii-
This film is witty, dark, funny, creepy, poignant, and above all else absolutely beautiful, full of wonderfully curated twists and turns. It's hard to place into a genre and that is what I absolutely love. Masterfully written, beautifully directed and the cinematography deserves allllll the awards.<br/><br/>I can't stop thinking about it and to me, that's when I know I've met my match. If you love cinema, or even if you don't, you have to see this film.
Here's to more international foreign films getting the recognition they deserve!</div>",Positive
674,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Orange beast and his supporters can stay fuming! Best Picture lol.</div>",Positive
675,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a kind of a movie where you can never be disappointed. It is funny, it is ironic, it is still obsessing me</div>",Positive
676,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try.</div>",Positive
677,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is phenomenal, it's epic, exciting, funny, has the awesome ultra-violent in the third act of the movie, it's so unique and powerful that it's so cool! This movie is just a masterpiece, and however hates it is just weird, because it's perfect in any way you look at!</div>",Positive
678,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Worthy of ever award and accolade that comes its way.</div>",Positive
679,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a brilliant movie, just watch it without reading too many reviews, you won't regret it.</div>",Positive
680,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not just a movie it's beautiful like a painting every scene, every shot, every moment is breathtaking and background score is apt and haunting....Bong Joon ho is the man</div>",Positive
681,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is always going to be known as the first international (nonEnglish) film to win best picture. I am glad that the Oscars finally honored world cinema and I am especially glad this is a very good movie.<br/><br/>I don't have much to add to what others have said. It is funny social satire, an engaging thriller and heart breaking drama (esp. the last shot of the film) rolled into a story that feels to go everywhere it needs to. I have watched this twice and it is such a engaging story first and foremost. That it also functions as a rebuke of capital makes the film richer but the social themes don't overwhelm it as pure storytelling.<br/><br/>The film has a great vertical aspect to its visual constructions. It has a lot of stairs in the film and the camera is moving up and down a lot during it. It is not overdone but the use of space is really striking. So glad I blind bought this.</div>",Positive
682,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the first time i have ever seen such a good Asia film like that! You will not regret if you pay some money to see that</div>",Positive
683,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought that it is kind of black joke things. Satirizing the polarization, poverty or bad condition of society is the things that i had imagined befrore i saw the movie. Did you also expect that? My answer is it'll never happen.<br/><br/>After the movie i feel like someone punch my head, and then i feel so bad at something that ican't explain what exactly it is.<br/><br/>Highly recommeded to see it.</div>",Positive
684,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides.</div>",Positive
685,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bit of a mazza throughout cannot lie. Mazza at the start, big mazza middle, mega mazza end. Overall, top mazza</div>",Positive
686,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An unexpected journey through an ironic a tragic account.</div>",Positive
687,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfect. What else can you say about the wonderful film.</div>",Positive
688,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Think of all movie genres you can think of and you will find a piece of everything in this movie.
This is unpredictable... this will intense. This will make you keep guessing and then you will be like wtf cuz none of your guesses would be right. This is everything.</div>",Positive
689,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Theme of the movie is unmatched. An experience of division between classes.
Bringing reality so subtly onto the screen.</div>",Positive
690,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!</div>",Positive
691,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A technically flawless film, director Bong Joon-ho has created a modern film classic that, not only transcends the language and cultural barriers separating it from the rest of the world, but has resonated on such a level allowing it to take home multiple Academy Awards at the 2019 ceremony, including the coveted ""Best Picture"" award. Kudos Mr. Bong Joon-ho.<br/><br/>Kudos.</div>",Positive
692,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honstly i never feel the need to write review but this one.. Wow i cant say anything coz it will ruin the surprise. But really , you would get out from the cinema feeling a mixture of everything.<br/><br/>This is genius. 🙌🏻🙌🏻</div>",Positive
693,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is simply beautiful. It is best to go into the movie with no knowledge of anything about it, and not having seen the trailers or read anything about it. Not having expectations made it much more exciting. I cannot recommend the movie enough, to really anyone who loves film and is willing to give it a chance. It won the Oscar for a reason. In my opinion, it very much deserved it.</div>",Positive
694,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A roller coaster of a movie with great characters and plot twists. A narrative that draws you in from start to end. A movie to add to all time favorites.</div>",Positive
695,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Good movie to watch when u are boring
Really recommended!!</div>",Positive
696,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time.</div>",Positive
697,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This one has the lot
Great movie
Great cinematography
Great script
Great acting
See it</div>",Positive
698,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.</div>",Positive
699,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best movie i've ever seen in decade, everything is so brilliant</div>",Positive
700,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best Picture well deserved. Thank you Bong, very cool.</div>",Positive
701,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.<br/><br/>Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it.</div>",Positive
702,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched ""Parasite"" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.
This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you.
The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is.
I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY.</div>",Positive
703,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I have ever seen. It teaches a lot about things we spot in everyday life. Movie starts from comedy to thriller.</div>",Positive
704,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Oscars, golden globe.. I had to see why. Now I know. my english is not good enough to say anything smart :) all I can say is wow..</div>",Positive
705,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's one of the greatest films I've ever watched in my life. Truly a masterpiece. It was so captivating and an emotional roller coaster. It's an absolute must see!! It deserved every award it got and I'm so proud to see it win 4 oscars. Truly deserved and more. Bong joon ho created one of the most creative, unique, amazing films I've seen.</div>",Positive
706,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it.
Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances &amp; plot.</div>",Positive
707,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In this movie Bong Joon-ho directs like Billy Wilder plus Alfred Hitchcock... the result is just unique. The plot is not only original but contemporary, funny, scary and poetic at the same time.
Remarkable.</div>",Positive
708,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My dad is someone that doesn't even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great. If thay doesn't cry out how great this film is then I don't know what.<br/><br/>This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything. Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite.</div>",Positive
709,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity</div>",Positive
710,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!</div>",Positive
711,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was really sceptical about ""Parasite"" in a way because of the hype, but I also had fate in the movie being good because
Bong Joon-ho have delivered knock out after knockout. (Okja, Snowpiercer)
Also I really like Song Kang Ho previous works.
Most notably ""The Taxi Driver"", which left me crying my eyes out on a 8h flight.
Do not recommend.<br/><br/>Anyways, Parasite is a masterpiece.
Every time I thought I'd figured the plot out there was a twist. Everyone also kept going on about the ending and I was like, meh.
Well, they were right about the ending.<br/><br/>Can't describe this movie. The plot is as indescribable as Fight Club, Get Out or Us.<br/><br/>Go watch it.</div>",Positive
712,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us.</div>",Positive
713,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching the Oscars I was curious about Parasite and knew I would have to watch it. I wasn't disappointed at all, most times when people hype something up I tend to think it's overrated. I was rooting for this down on their luck family even though they were technically committing a crime. Who hasn't lied on a resume to get a job ? I didn't see the ending coming at all so that was a shock.</div>",Positive
714,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Parasite shows Korean house architects that calls 'Banjiha'(lower level house). Because it appears only at Korea, I taught its mood for Korean, but all over the world liked it!.</div>",Positive
715,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a movie ! What a story ! Beautiful , inventive, original, at the end you are on heaven...</div>",Positive
716,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A film with a simple storyline but has a very extraordinary concept. Every now and then you can guess what might happen, but once it's not guessed you will get goosebumps because of the beauty of the story of this film. At the beginning and at the end of the film it's very contrasting, really beautiful.</div>",Positive
717,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching, I see my fight against the system (life, society, Capitalism) as a fight for all of the people who still eager for a fight.</div>",Positive
718,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There will be movies after parasite and before parasite. There are not enough words for me to describe a movie like this, and i'm not gonna even try.
it's a masterpiece comes in once in every generation.</div>",Positive
719,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely Fantastic. The best movie i've seen in my life.</div>",Positive
720,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fav movie of the year. Consistent and contrasting, heartbreaking and breathtaking, beautiful yet ugly, morality and mentality. Just love every frame of the movie. Stunning. Speechless.</div>",Positive
721,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">From a thriller of Memories of Murder to a monster film of The Host, Bong Joon Ho could transform a family drama as entertaining as never before.<br/><br/>Truly an unexpected, perfect, blend of genres to satirize class division and hypocrisy.<br/><br/>Even the dialogue scenes are not tiresome, but intriguing and often hilarious.<br/><br/>Well done Korean Cinema, proud of you!</div>",Positive
722,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.<br/><br/>This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one.</div>",Positive
723,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nice and deep, great movie! This Korean palm is worthy of the name!!</div>",Positive
724,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Social satire movies usually are serious, but Bong made this movie so thrilling &amp; fun to watch. It will both make &amp; ruin your day.</div>",Positive
725,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A beautiful journey of emotions.
Delivers a strong subject, so interestingly and with a bunch of great actors, incredibly directed by Mr.Bong<br/><br/>A very important film.
Kangsammidha</div>",Positive
726,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was reluctant to watch this. I could see from the trailer that it has good production value, yet I was worried it would be too ""weird"", being a Korean/Asian language film. Eventually I did watch it and I am glad! I'm also glad it won all those Oscars.<br/><br/>The blend of dark comedy in this social thriller definitely attributed to an enjoyable and entertaining experience and made me more engaged with the story. It is very well made and it deals with various interesting subjects/issues of our society, all in the premise of a collision of social classes (extreme poverty with extreme wealth).</div>",Positive
727,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture. Some think it was entirely political as this is the first ever foreign language film to win this award. I advise them to watch it because you cannot say it didn't deserve an Oscar if you didn't. It's just wonderful and shows how heavily underrated and overlooked Non-English films are.</div>",Positive
728,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.<br/><br/>Parasite did it in less than 2 hours.</div>",Positive
729,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie so much!
The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist.
All my friends who watched it liked and so did I.
I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language.
Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.
After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films.</div>",Positive
730,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic</div>",Positive
731,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is truly a masterpiece...! I don't understand how this movie with such local sentiments can deliver something that is so universal...!The best cinematic experience I had this year. Everything is perfect.</div>",Positive
732,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.<br/><br/>This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest.</div>",Positive
733,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is amazing! One of the best films I have ever seen. Parasite definitely deserved to win Best Picture despite no matter how much a certain somebody disagrees. Don't let subtitles keep you from experiencing this wonderful piece of movie art!</div>",Positive
734,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen.</div>",Positive
735,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At first, you'll see it as a comedy, but then the director take you on a magical mystery ride and you'll never know what waiting for you up ahead. 10/10 a must watch movie</div>",Positive
736,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Story
All unemployed, Ki-taek and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.
REVIEW
As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..
RATING
4.0/5.0</div>",Positive
737,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety.</div>",Positive
738,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A really good movie, that deserved the Oscar, i was cheering for Joker but what the hell right?</div>",Positive
739,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is like a travel on its own, good details and an amazing story. It covers all the genres in one.</div>",Positive
740,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical.
It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it.
10/10 + Oscar</div>",Positive
741,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing.</div>",Positive
742,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The storytelling is amazing! Bong Joon Ho did it again.</div>",Positive
743,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am grateful to have learned to read early and not have problems with subtitles. Americans should try a little to be less lazy.</div>",Positive
744,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment.</div>",Positive
745,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-ho strikes again with this modern art masterpiece, this movie literally blew my mind with its great combination of comedy and tragedy.
One of the finest, perfect, enjoyable movies of this decade, Thanks to Bong Joon-ho and thanks to the seventh art who allows us to witness such beauty like this.</div>",Positive
746,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL.</div>",Positive
747,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movies are about people. And this movie described struggle of lower class. A beatiful piece.</div>",Positive
748,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Precise acting,
meticulous editing,
meaningful story,
dramatically funny story telling,
inspiring ending,
unnoticeable yet tangible music,
...multi oscar material.</div>",Positive
749,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know how to start this I'm speechless!!<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything but WATCH IT!!</div>",Positive
750,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best Movie 2020 . Sure Shot Oscar In every Compition . Worth watching .</div>",Positive
751,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have seen many films this decade, especially in 2019. However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece.</div>",Positive
752,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.<br/><br/>its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended.</div>",Positive
753,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: ""Who is living of whom?"" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless.</div>",Positive
754,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">NEVER seen a movie like this. Wow what a masterpiece! Twist after twist, it had it ALL!!!</div>",Positive
755,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a great unique master piece! the kind of movie that surprises you. its hard to know whats coming next.</div>",Positive
756,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can sit here and talk about how the acting was, and what the parasite represents, how this movie can change the industry, and how the lightning and music was.. all the typical reviewer bull****
But I actually just wanna give this 10 stars and urge YOU to go watch it. Please do yourself the favor.. It's fantastic!</div>",Positive
757,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.<br/><br/>THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.<br/><br/>And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.<br/><br/>Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades.</div>",Positive
758,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Tigers every human emotion<br/><br/>its hilarious
its dark
its original
its powerful
its thought provoking<br/><br/>time well spent</div>",Positive
759,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic.</div>",Positive
760,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is not a horror movie not a suspense movie but I was just on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece  with your morals as well as your feelings for justice.</div>",Positive
761,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A cinematic peach: every dialogue and visual drips with succulent style and significance, while the plot is as juicy as they come (the night of drinking-basement discovery-escape into the rain was a standout sequence). It's contrived but in the most well-rounded, delicious way possible (see the phenomenal editing and music building to the masterful hot sauce tissue climax of the first half), its flavourful flesh unearthing a pit of potent commentary on wealth and status in the second half.
9.5/10</div>",Positive
762,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality.</div>",Positive
763,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The art of the uncomfortable..
When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel..
'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy &amp; empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this..
One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'?
One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing..
A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s)..
Between so much more was said in the unsaid and that is the beauty of this cleverly written, acted, directed Korean tragic, haunting, conflicting, comedy classic..
A must watch👍👍👍</div>",Positive
764,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a fan of Korean movies it's impossible for me to avoid various titles which leave me the feeling of adaptations from western and europe movies.<br/><br/>So far not disappointed
Koreans knows how to spice things<br/><br/>Parasite (2019)
Borgman (2013)
3-Iron (2004)</div>",Positive
765,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already a situation which held such uncertainty for the future well-being our characters, rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line between success and absolute failure, creating some of the most tense moments I have ever seen in any movie. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.<br/><br/>With a finely crafted script, honest emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time.</div>",Positive
766,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre. It's intense, gritty yet subtle like- rollercoaster inside of a maze- type journey will leave you speechless at the end of this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
767,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it. I've enjoyed Bong Joon Ho's previews work but I wanted to enter the cinema with with a clear mind and no expectations. And I was shocked. The movie, every aspect of it, is perfect, from music to script everything was just beautiful. Easy best movie of the year and one of the best of this decade.</div>",Positive
768,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had a very high expectation for ""Parasite"", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!</div>",Positive
769,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Korean film makers literally have such a interesting mind. Absolutely unique and a film I'll never forget!</div>",Positive
770,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!</div>",Positive
771,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Extreme! Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a good criticism about the rich and poor in the world.. the movie is really interesting and pretty sad... worth it. Please watch it. You will not regret it.</div>",Positive
772,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor</div>",Positive
773,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish.</div>",Positive
774,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best film I've seen in a long while, great plot good twist highly recommended</div>",Positive
775,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw this movie today after keeping it for shelves for 2 months......a reality in today's world...... acting was top notch. Don't have any words to explain the story. It's simple mind-blowing. Keeps you on hook till the end. One of the best korean movies of the last decade. Hopefully no one will remake it and spoil this classic</div>",Positive
776,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this.</div>",Positive
777,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?<br/><br/>""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?<br/><br/>It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film.</div>",Positive
778,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After watching the most overrated korean movie ever ""the burning"", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it.</div>",Positive
779,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better</div>",Positive
780,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.<br/><br/>Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.<br/><br/>Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time.</div>",Positive
781,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.
Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience.</div>",Positive
782,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece.</div>",Positive
783,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it.</div>",Positive
784,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.</div>",Positive
785,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Parasite"" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film.
.
In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.
.
Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see.</div>",Positive
786,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought that this was definetly one generic movie (everything nice-something happens- that situation is solved) but it was not. I was amazed by the expression that the director has put on this film. Very nice original story and graphism.
I would recommend everyone to watch this.
This movie truly deserved the oscar.</div>",Positive
787,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best movie in 2019 really it fantastic I really enjoyed and loved a actors and I feeled I was lived with them that is the first Korea move I ever watch</div>",Positive
788,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner.</div>",Positive
789,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists.
Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away.
Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals.
But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.
9,8 / 10</div>",Positive
790,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.</div>",Positive
791,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence.
It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life.</div>",Positive
792,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time.
Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes.
The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting.
I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them.</div>",Positive
793,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller &amp; drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters &amp; plot twists.<br/><br/>Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.<br/><br/>My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events.</div>",Positive
794,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.</div>",Positive
795,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie.</div>",Positive
796,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family.
I'm also gonna build myself a bunker.</div>",Positive
797,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!</div>",Positive
798,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece.</div>",Positive
799,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning</div>",Positive
800,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10</div>",Positive
801,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Korean drama and thriller written &amp; directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art</div>",Positive

830,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family.
I'm also gonna build myself a bunker.</div>",Positive
831,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!</div>",Positive
832,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece.</div>",Positive
833,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning</div>",Positive
834,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10</div>",Positive
835,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Korean drama and thriller written &amp; directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art</div>",Positive
836,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best.
This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth.
The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood.
Everybody must watch this movie.</div>",Positive
837,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece</div>",Positive
838,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great, Masterpiece.
This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor.
At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film.</div>",Positive
839,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography.</div>",Positive
840,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!</div>",Positive
841,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!</div>",Positive
842,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making.</div>",Positive
843,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!</div>",Positive
844,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).<br/><br/>It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning.</div>",Positive
845,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more.</div>",Positive
846,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.</div>",Positive
847,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.<br/><br/>I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded.</div>",Positive
848,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better.</div>",Positive
849,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades.</div>",Positive
850,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it</div>",Positive
851,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.</div>",Positive
852,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Fantastic gtreatest movie. Win the best motion picture award really.</div>",Positive
853,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Parents this film is rated R for language sexual content and violence</div>",Positive
854,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion.
I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot.
Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous.
For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption.</div>",Positive
855,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Compelling characters, gripping plot, Parasite everything a movie should be. Stupefyingly unpredictable, it's remarkably refreshing and leaves you drop jawed at its conclusion.</div>",Positive
856,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all.</div>",Positive
857,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.</div>",Positive
858,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the best movie of 2019, over.
RESPECT, over.</div>",Positive
859,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Damn you south Korea. You're going through one movie after another. Korean movies are a class movie. After watching this movie, I was in the house for about 3 weeks. They can make such a movie. How natural is the act of one man. After the end of the movie many questions were coming to the head. Who is the parasite ???</div>",Positive
860,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films of the decade... With an impressive cast and a talented and an critically acclaimed directed this movie delivers what it promises.</div>",Positive
861,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?</div>",Positive
862,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it.</div>",Positive
863,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece.</div>",Positive
864,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches.</div>",Positive
865,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.<br/><br/>Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this film.</div>",Positive
866,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Original, creative, involving story.<br/><br/>Great acting with a crisp production.<br/><br/>One of the best in 2019</div>",Positive
867,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie left me speechless. A true masterpiece. Really creative and innovative.</div>",Positive
868,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019.</div>",Positive
869,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.</div>",Positive
870,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can say that i did not expect that how one movie could affected me like that.
All i can this movie is speechless.
This is so original &amp; real.
This is real life, i am so sad to see that how can poor people and capitalism world can do this to any human being... and also the ''smell''... the best version to explain that how people can feel low, terrible. and how rich people can consider any human being like their slave in modern world. only the system can do this. this film is real because its showing the real world, capitalism and how the poor people can fearless about any other human being in order to get money from them. its scary but its real. this movie shows that you cant trust anyone.</div>",Positive
871,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One thing I always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like ""yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal. Movie is fast paced and I quite liked the ending. Surely one of the best movie of this decade</div>",Positive
872,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative.
The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other.</div>",Positive
873,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.<br/><br/>It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.<br/><br/>It's such a fantastic social commentary.</div>",Positive
874,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional.</div>",Positive
875,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't get enough of it. I watched it second time and it is even better than first time and first time was like amazing amazing.</div>",Positive
876,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019.</div>",Positive
877,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.<br/><br/>Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens.</div>",Positive
878,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special.</div>",Positive
879,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks
very subtly written, amazing comedia
I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars
And it deserves more than this
Best Korean movie ever made!
----------<br/><br/>I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol</div>",Positive
880,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece.</div>",Positive
881,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!</div>",Positive
882,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.
Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.
This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.
At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all "".</div>",Positive
883,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film.</div>",Positive
884,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.<br/><br/>Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10</div>",Positive
885,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year</div>",Positive
886,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is so great . In my opinion , parasite is one of top 10 movies of the last decade .</div>",Positive
887,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie</div>",Positive
888,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.</div>",Positive
889,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!</div>",Positive
890,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.</div>",Positive
891,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019.</div>",Positive
892,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family.</div>",Positive
893,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite.</div>",Positive
894,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Probably the best movie of this year. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Acting is so natural and trailer didn't reveal anything to me and I'm grateful for that. This is another Korean masterpiece and it reminds me a little of Oldboy. It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.</div>",Positive
895,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie lives in this time
An amazing sweet thriller movie.
Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood</div>",Positive
896,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!</div>",Positive
897,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth ""Brilliant"", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥</div>",Positive
898,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.
The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world.</div>",Positive
899,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great .
This movie can thinking everything many type of question &amp; ending is super-level....</div>",Positive
900,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The suspense, drama, accuracy with the real life, visually amazing. It's just beautiful.</div>",Positive
901,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">At first sight I gave 10, but being close to the end of the movie I was thinking...""no, no 10, but 8"", because I doubted how they could miss what was with Moon-gwang, and then the story mentioned what was with her and I moved back to 10. :) The whole concept is great, from the story, music and photography to acting and style. Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially.</div>",Positive
902,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.<br/><br/>The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.<br/><br/>It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.<br/><br/>I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future.</div>",Positive
903,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.<br/><br/>The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.<br/><br/>I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live.</div>",Positive
904,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019</div>",Positive
905,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it.</div>",Positive
906,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting.
What a film.</div>",Positive
907,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a thrilling, funny, surprising and satirical society. This is perfect film.</div>",Positive
908,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">People can be parasites is what is it about this film and have lots of messages!</div>",Positive
909,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Academy has made a great decision on to laureate Parasite as Oscars' 2020 Best Original Screenplay, Best Film, Best Directing and Best Picture Awards. Besides having written a new chapter on Cinema's History as the first non-English-language movie to have gained this epic achievement, the Korean film is a timeless masterpiece, whose stylistics, cinematography, editing work, original screenplay and final outcome will be studied for decades and ever!<br/><br/>Best Picture to Parasite!
More than well-deserved!</div>",Positive
910,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A true masterpiece. I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film.</div>",Positive
911,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With engaging performances, a deft use of dark comedy, and thrilling twists that add up, Parasite is a smart and haunting take on conflicting social classes, showing how both the poor and the wealthy can equally be the villains in their respectively desperate and callous ways. It's not impossible to respect each other and co-exist. Parasite has really opened my eyes to foreign language films and rightfully deserves its historic Best Picture win. A stunning film.</div>",Positive
912,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture.</div>",Positive
913,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.<br/><br/>I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder.</div>",Positive
914,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.</div>",Positive
915,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already.</div>",Positive
916,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie.</div>",Positive
917,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing.</div>",Positive
918,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watch the movie and experience the Masterpiece made by the director who is famous for his films like Memories of Murder, Mother, The Host, Snowpiercer, Okja and now this. This film in actual sense depicts the Thinking &amp; Artistic vision director Bong Joon Ho has &amp; his extreme passion &amp; love about the cinema. There's no way anyone can hate Parasite.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is outstanding; from acting to direction, from a hunch to screenplay. But the very important thing I felt about the movie is brilliant minds worked in Art direction &amp; Lighting team. Cinematography is the thing which you can learn from this movie in the detailed and polished way.<br/><br/>At last, I think this film will be the milestone in not only the Korean film industry but also in the World Cinema.</div>",Positive
919,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is a masterpiece, a cinematic slap. Parasite is cinematic perfection. It's not just my favourite film of the year, it's in my top 5 of my best movies of the last decade. Just when you think you know what type of movie it is, it suddenly becomes a completely different movie when you least expect it. Crazy, funny, incredibly smart. I loved it. I've tried to keep my review to a minimum because the less said about this movie the better, everyone needs to see this movie !</div>",Positive
920,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.<br/><br/>This says a lot about this one.<br/><br/>Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later.</div>",Positive
921,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.<br/><br/>I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.<br/><br/>This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.<br/><br/>What a film.</div>",Positive
922,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!!
People need to watch this!!!!</div>",Positive
923,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its really difficult for a new film to come out &amp; satisfy me &amp; outperform well known masterpiece thrillers from the sixth sense to modern mystery inception
But this movie did exactly that i loved this movie more than fight club, inception, se7en,gonegirl,shutter island
Give it try for first 5 min, then. U will witness the greatest achievement in filmmaking of this decade
This movie has set new standard which i think difficult to crack for normal director</div>",Positive
924,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply Amazing. The movie has a little bit of everything. One of the best films I've seen.</div>",Positive
925,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!</div>",Positive
926,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.<br/><br/>If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!</div>",Positive
927,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!</div>",Positive
928,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.</div>",Positive
929,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.<br/><br/>At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.<br/><br/>A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.<br/><br/>Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes.
Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me.
""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way""</div>",Positive
930,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece</div>",Positive
931,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!</div>",Positive
932,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not perfect, but it's brilliant in many ways. The director should be awarded.</div>",Positive
933,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.<br/><br/>It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.<br/><br/>Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".<br/><br/>P.S. The house is a dream of architecture.</div>",Positive
934,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight</div>",Positive
935,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S. Kings Misery. This movie is realistic and immersive, simply a must watch film, with lots of hard work and time put into it, unforgettable.</div>",Positive
936,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie.
Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!</div>",Positive
937,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!</div>",Positive
938,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!</div>",Positive
939,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece.</div>",Positive
940,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻</div>",Positive
941,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie.</div>",Positive
942,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon.</div>",Positive
943,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me.</div>",Positive
944,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely the best movie of 2019. Everybody who loves cinema must see this film.</div>",Positive
945,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.</div>",Positive
946,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year.</div>",Positive
947,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..</div>",Positive
948,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.<br/><br/>And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it.</div>",Positive
949,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">You will watch it and you know it has subtleties
It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other
It doesn't bore you for a single minute
It is the best this year</div>",Positive
950,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed.
If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you.</div>",Positive
951,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it.
I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars.</div>",Positive
952,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem.</div>",Positive
953,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized.</div>",Positive
954,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">In some ways its kinda scary and its because you never know who you think you know. Also, this movie in some ways reminds me of Sweenie Todd and The Family in one. Anyway, better than both and is a must watch!</div>",Positive
955,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure.</div>",Positive
956,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling ""Parasite,"" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none.</div>",Positive
957,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!</div>",Positive
958,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!</div>",Positive
959,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars</div>",Positive
960,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all.</div>",Positive
961,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape.</div>",Positive
962,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">10/10 - undoubtedly original and captivating...this is why we go to the cinema</div>",Positive
963,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.</div>",Positive
964,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019</div>",Positive
965,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you like Asian cinema and are curious about which movie to see before tonight's oscar ceremony then this movie is a must see. Despite being a Korean movie with subs it has a lot of excitement and drama to make it an upset at tonight's telecast.</div>",Positive
966,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be ""woke"".<br/><br/>Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.<br/><br/>I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being born<br/><br/>Bong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize.</div>",Positive
967,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !
Avoid spoilers</div>",Positive
968,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. This film is a milestone for Korean cinema. Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.<br/><br/>
""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""</div>",Positive
969,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade.</div>",Positive
970,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2019.</div>",Positive
971,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.</div>",Positive
972,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema.</div>",Positive
973,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end</div>",Positive
974,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!</div>",Positive
975,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!</div>",Positive
976,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone. This genre-defying film picks up the social differences between rich and poor and mix it up with some of the best twists in the entire history of cinema.</div>",Positive
977,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movie was class. Like very class. If you know what i mean? This was so class, imagine Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. Class.</div>",Positive
978,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.</div>",Positive
979,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">After 6th watch I think I got all little details and all messages. I really love the climate change/rain message. He changes genres so smoothly and never bored me once on my 3rd watch in last week and a half. I just gotta say Bravo Bong!!!</div>",Positive
980,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.<br/><br/>A masterpiece.</div>",Positive
981,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!</div>",Positive
982,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time
One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie</div>",Positive
983,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""<br/><br/>I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.<br/><br/>And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece.</div>",Positive
984,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art. The plot refelects human nature and what limits we are ready to cross in order to make ourselves secure and ignore our inhibitions no matter the cost. 2019 couldn't end any better....</div>",Positive
985,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just wanted to register my ""10"" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted.</div>",Positive
986,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.</div>",Positive
987,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it! It's about a family that lives in a little house that want better things. Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography, writing, production design, and captivating characters! Well deserving of the awards/nominations; unfortunate people didn't like the movie.</div>",Positive
988,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Amazing Director
Amazing cast
Amazing performances
One of the most mind blowing movies of the Decade
Thank you Mr.Bong.Joon.Ho</div>",Positive
989,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it.</div>",Positive
990,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure.</div>",Positive
991,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb</div>",Positive
992,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result.
I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE</div>",Positive
993,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is a masterpiece
I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits.</div>",Positive
994,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">My favorite movie of 2019..
Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture</div>",Positive
995,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10.
If you have watched some good old Korean movies such as bediveled, old boy, yellow sea and memories of murder you know this movie stands on equal footing with those movie
I've watched joker
Fordvs Ferrari
Jojo rabbit
1917
Marriage story<br/><br/>Parasite beats all these movies by a huge difference.</div>",Positive
996,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I felt a roller coaster of emotions watching this movie; everything about it so perfectly executed. What makes this movie insanely good is the actors, story, plot and narrative.<br/><br/>Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???</div>",Positive
997,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched this film yesterday, really love this story. And surprised the academy even knowledged it.😳</div>",Positive
998,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more.</div>",Positive
999,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This time I watched it in theatre with very annoying crowd. They laughed all the time but the reaction to second half of the movies was priceless (everyone was like wtf is happening). Oscars not nominating Kang-ho Song for best supporting actor is a disgrace.
Also, it deserved at least cinematography nomination but whatever.</div>",Positive
1000,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks.</div>",Positive
1001,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">""A waterproof toy tent, and a semi-basement house that got flooded""</div>",Positive
1002,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret</div>",Positive
1003,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">A must watch .. mesmerising with mixed overwhelming feelings throughout the two hours.. it doesn't leave you after it ends; you cannot help but continue think of what if!</div>",Positive
1004,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just the rest of the world, and the academy, catching up with what my husband and I have known for years: Korean writers are absolute masters at plot twists and characterization! If you don't agree, watch a few more Korean movies to get adjusted to the cultural differences, and you'll see.</div>",Positive
1005,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!</div>",Positive
1006,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed.
Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed.
Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed.</div>",Positive
1007,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.<br/><br/>The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...<br/><br/>everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period.</div>",Positive
1008,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today.</div>",Positive
1009,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Opening scene .. quite funny .. and wity .. movie goes in a very funny way and .. keep us for there ..
later the movie is gets involving and .. stroy pick ups yhe the pace ... hats off to the actors .. and director giving a such good content .. it's not a movie it's ART ..
MUST WATCH MOVIE</div>",Positive
1010,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">One of the best film in foreign language !!!
Actually it's not a film,
It's our real life story...
I have nothing more to say about this great creation.....</div>",Positive
1011,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed.
It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino ..
Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .<br/><br/>Kudo's</div>",Positive
1012,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.</div>",Positive
1013,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Utterly bonkers at times but always brilliant something completely fresh for the first time in a long while. Loved every second couldn't take my eyes off the screen words can not justify just how great this film was other than films this good and this original really don't come around very often. Truly riveting and a true joy to watch.</div>",Positive
1014,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor.</div>",Positive
1015,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">When we were student in art faculty, our teachers use to say to us ""art or artist can't be unbiased, you pick a side and tell your story."" I never agreed. This film approved I was right.</div>",Positive
1016,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.<br/><br/>It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!</div>",Positive
1017,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.<br/><br/>One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?<br/><br/>And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify.</div>",Positive
1018,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.</div>",Positive
1019,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film.</div>",Positive
1020,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Far and away one of the best films you'll ever see.</div>",Positive
1021,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.<br/><br/>This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯</div>",Positive
1022,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.<br/><br/>This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it.</div>",Positive
1023,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days.</div>",Positive
1024,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!</div>",Positive
1025,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.<br/><br/>The last movie that evoked so many strong emotions was Precious, in 2009.</div>",Positive
1026,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances.</div>",Positive
1027,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!<br/><br/>The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.<br/><br/>The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it.</div>",Positive
1028,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough.</div>",Positive
1029,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Believe the hype. This is one of the best if not the best film in years. Watch it and you'll see why</div>",Positive
1030,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.</div>",Positive
1031,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy.</div>",Positive
1032,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is about so much more than class differences. It's survival,what you would do for your family.
Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions.
I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!</div>",Positive
1033,"<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending.</div>",Positive
